00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
CBS presents this program in color.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
<v ANNOUNCER (VO)>
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center, 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
home of the world's greatest musical 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
events -- another program of NEW YORK 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
PHILHARMONIC Young People's Concerts 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
under the musical direction of Leonard 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Bernstein,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Brought to you by ---

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And here is Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Bernstein> My dear young friends: On our last program, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
if you recall, we were celebrating the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
double anniversary of our New York 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Philharmonic and the Vienna Philharmonik 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
- both 125 years old. Well, we are 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
still celebrating it - only this time in a 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
very special way - by playing Beethoven. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now what, you will ask, has Beethoven got 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to do with our anniversary? A lot; and I'll 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
tell you why. I have been looking at the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
opening programs played by both 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
orchestras back there in 1842, and I 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
found one striking similarity between 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
them: the name of Beethoven is 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
all over the place. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
He had the market cornered, 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
a mere fifteen years after his death.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.680
SKIPPED
For example, looking at the New York program, we find that out of the 8 pieces played two were by Beethoven - and that includes a whole symphony and a long aria from his opera, Fidelio, - making almost an hour of Beethoven alone! The Vienna program went even further:
Vienna Program 1842 out of the 8 pieces they played 4 were by Beethoven - half of the program -including again, a whole symphony, two overtures and another long aria - well over an hour of Beethoven. A little simple arithmetic shows us that out of the 16 pieces played by both orchestras, 6 were by Beethoven - 6 out of 16, which means that if these programs were typical of their time (and they were) a fat, solid 38% of all symphonic music played in 1842 was by Beethoven.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But what's even more remarkable is that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that 38% still holds today. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
SKIPPED
(That percentage has gone up to ) 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
He still has the market cornered. Today an all-

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Beethoven concert is a very frequent 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
happening. And what is the main 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
piece on every piano recital? A Beethoven 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
sonata. And during the last World War, 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
what was our musical symbol for victory? 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Pah-pah-pah-PAH. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Beethoven's Fifth.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And when a great man dies, what do we play?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The funeral march from Beethoven's 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Eroica. And on United Nations Day, or 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Brotherhood week, or whatever, 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
what is the inevitable piece of 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
music? Beethoven's Ninth. Why, even the 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Beatles featured it in their film "Help." 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And look at Schroeder in Peanuts: To him 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Beethoven's birthday is more important 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
than the 4th of July. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's Beethoven, Beethoven, forever 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Beethoven - a name that's almost become 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
a synonym for music itself. And who was 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
this giant with the magic name? 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
He was s short, stubby fellow, not Viennese

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
at all, not even Austrian, but German, from 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the town of Bonn on the Rhine River, 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
where he was born in 1770. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
At the age of 22 he 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
was sent to Vienna by the local big-shots of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
his home town, 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
since Vienna was the place for music - 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
for studying and making a career.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And so this little provincial chap with bad 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
skin and a comedy accent from the 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Rhineland arrived in Vienna, knocked 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
everyone dead, and was taken up by the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Viennese nobility and made a hero.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
His fame spread, and he soon dominated the musical scene, 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
which he has dominated ever 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
since - the mighty, the colossal, the 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
profound, the revolutionary, the mystic, 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
romantic Beethoven. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He was also bad-tempered, 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
stubborn, ill-mannered, opinionated, 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
moody, and miserly. But out of this homely 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
human vessel,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
a voice spoke that was 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
more than human - a voice with the ring and the 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
conviction of something eternal, 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
something that still today makes us 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
tingle with the certainty that a 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
divine spark exists in every one of us.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now why should this be? I've been trying all 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
my life to find out. The very first 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
television program I ever did was 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
about Beethoven. The very 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
first chapter of my first book is called 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
"Why Beethoven?" Well, I'm still asking that 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
question, and will probably never find a 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
total answer. Mighty, colossal - those words 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
just don't explain anything. Because the 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
final answer is a mystery - the mystery of 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
why this one particular 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
shaggy-headed little man should have 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
been chosen to wallop the galaxies with his music.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And so we shall have an all-Beethoven

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
program today, beginning, as we began 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
125 years ago, with those four heaven-

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
storming notes that announce the first 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
movement of his Fifth Symphony."

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Did you grasp 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the fantastic shape of that movement? The perfect 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
definition, the exactness, of starts and 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
stops, of holding back and plunging ahead, 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
of the sudden mysterious drops and the 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
wild eruptions? Every split-second is 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
measured and molded by a master.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And apropos of this shaping, 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
there is an important thing that needs to 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
be said, and I'm going to 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
run the risk of boring you 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
with a tiny lecture in order to try to say it. You've 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
probably heard of a popular biography of 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Beethoven called "The Man Who Freed Music."

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now this title has always caused me a 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
certain disquiet. What does it 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
mean? Freed music from what? From Bach? 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
From Nozart? Haydn? Well hardly: 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
they all had plenty of freedom of their 

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
own. The truth is that all great composers 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
free music - not from the bondage of other 

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
composers, but from routine, from 

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
mediocrity, from second-rate, dusty 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
tradition; in other words, a great 

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
composer frees music from the 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
predictable. Take one of Beethoven's 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
most obvious examples of the 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
unpredictable - the opening tune of 

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
his third Symphony, the Eroica. 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It rides along in E-b major on 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the nice, expected notes of the tonic 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000
triad for four bars,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and then, on the fifth bar, the unexpected happens:

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Bang! - That D-b! Surprise: the bondage of 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
the Triad is broken. Music is freed. But 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
freed by what? By a Db- and that's 

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
just the point: 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
a Db, not a Cb or an A 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
but that one, chosen, limited note, 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Db-that did the freeing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Doesn't this tell us something very important 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
about the nature of freedom? Obviously 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
freedom must carry with it the meaning 

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
of freedom to limit oneself, and one's 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
material. Freedom is not infinite, not

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
boundless liberty, as some hippies like 

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to think - do anything you want, any time, 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
anywhere you want to. No, freedom 

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
means being free to make 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
decisions, to determine one's course.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
But decision means choice; 

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and choice is impossible without 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
rejection. Can you understand that? 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You can't choose something without 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
rejecting all the other things you 

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
haven't chosen. If you choose one 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
apple out of a dozen, you automatically 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
unchoose the other eleven, and if Beethoven 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
chooses that one D-Flat, he automatically

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
un-chooses all the other eleven notes.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So you see, real freedom must contain 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
within itself the freedom to un-choose, 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to censor oneself, to limit 

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
oneself. That is the whole meaning of 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
democracy, the kind of freedom on which 

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
we base our hopes for a peaceful world - 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
just as it is the meaning of freedom in 

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
great musical invention. In Beethoven, 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
as in democracy, freedom is a discipline,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
combining the right to choose freely,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and the gift of choosing wisely. Now do 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you see what I mean by Beethoven's 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
masterly shaping of that movement? I hope so! End 

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
of lecture. Now we are going to hear

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
more of that great free discipline in 

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
action - the last two movements of 

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto. 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
This performance is made even more important by the fact that we will have as our piano soloist a young artist who has the depth and power 

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to match this music - a 21-year old

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Israeli named Jospeph Kalichstein.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Ordinarily we present our young artists on one special Young Performers' program - but this young man is of such talent as to justify his appearing on a program about Beethoven. Can there be any greater praise?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
He will be accompanied by one of our young 

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
assistant conductors, - Paul Capolongo, 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
a very gifted young Frenchman, born in Algiers.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
And here they are —

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
KALICHSTEIN	Joseph Kalichstein and Paul Capolongo.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
We have 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
been talking about the connection 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
between Beethoven and freedom; 

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
and nowhere is that connection more evident 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
than in Beethoven's opera Fidelio. 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
This was the only opera Beethoven ever wrote, 

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
but he wrote it and rewrote it and 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
rewrote it over a period of twelve years. 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
This, of course, was typical, of Beethoven 

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
in his search for perfection; all his

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
works went through long agonies of 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
rewriting and scratching out and trying 

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
again -that was the price he paid for his 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
freedom, the price of free choice - to make 

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
the exactly right choice. But, with his 

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
opera Fidelio the agony was even worse, 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
and I think one of the main reasons was 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
that the story of the opera deals with 

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
the very subject of freedom itself. 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
The hero of the story is a young Spaniard named Florestan, 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
who has been unjustly imprisoned for 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
speaking out freely against tyranny.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.500
The whole opera takes place in the prison where the villainous governor Don Pizzaro has Florestan locked in a dungeon, planning eventually to have him killed. 

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.000
Florestan's faithful wife, 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Leonore, has managed to sneak into the 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
prison disguised as a boy, and gets a job 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
as the jailor's assistant so that she can 

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
help her husband escape. That is the basic plot of the opera.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
SKIPPED
And toward the end there is a glorious exciting moment when FIorestan is rescued just as he is about to be killed:	we suddenly hear the far-off
trumpet-call that announces the arrival of the rescue-party; there is a race against time, but the trumpet-call comes nearer, and finally all is saved - freedom triumphs and injustice is punished.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Now why is this opera called Fidelio? 

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Because that is the name Leonore takes 

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
in her disguise as a boy. And even here 

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Beethoven wrestled with 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
his freedoms of choice:	The opera was

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
first called Fidelio and then changed to 

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Leonore and then back 

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
to Fidelio. And the overture to the opera 

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
most clearly of all reflects the agony 

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
of free choices:	

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
there are not one but four overtures to this opera. 

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
The original one was called, peculiarly enough, Overture to Leonora. But Beethoven was not satisfied with it, and wrote a second Leonore Overture - and then, believe it or not, a whole new third one - Leonore #3.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
As if that weren't enough exercise in unchoosing, he finally wound up with a fourth overture, known as the Overture to Fidelio.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Out of all four, it is the 3rd Leonore Overture that 

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
is the masterpiece, and the one we are 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000
going to play now. It is a massive work - 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
more than just an overture, rather 

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
like a great symphonic poem 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
describing the whole opera. During its slow 

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
introduction we feel the heavy, brooding 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000
atmosphere of Florestan's dungeon, 

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
then, when the main fast section begins, 

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
we hear the gradually rising hope of 

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
rescue surging up through the orchestra, 

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
and the excitement is made even more 

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
dramatic by alternating with moods of 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
prayer and of love music. At the climax 

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
the orchestra is suddenly cut off, and the 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
famous trumpet-call of liberation sounds 

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
in the distance 

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
(You'11 hear it 

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
coming from somewhere backstage): 

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Then there is a moment of hushed 

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
suspense, then again the trumpet-call, nearer this 

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
time, and finally the triumphant 

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
achievement of freedom, in a coda of 

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
brilliant celebration. As you listen now to 

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
this essay on liberty, you can 

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
understand why Beethoven has always 

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
meant so much to us. 

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
As long as the human race struggles for 

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
freedom. 

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:39.000
SKIPPED
- and it's a long struggle - Beethoven's music will be our watchword.
