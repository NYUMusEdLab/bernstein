Well, we're00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000still celebrating it only this time in a00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000very special way by playing Beethoven.00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000Now what you will ask as Beethoven got00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000to do with our anniversary? Well; I'll00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000tell you. I've been looking at the two00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000opening programs played by the two00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000orchestras way back there in 1842, and I00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000found one striking similarity between00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000them: the name Ludwig van Beethoven is00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000all over the place, almost a half of all00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000the pieces played by both orchestras00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000were by Beethoven.00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000He had the market cornered, and this was00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000a mere 15 years after his death. But00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000what's even more remarkable is that00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000today he is still by far the most often00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000played symphonic composer that has ever lived.00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000He still has the market cornered. An all-00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000Beethoven concert is an everyday00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000occurrence isn't it and what's the main00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000piece on every piano recital? A Beethoven00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000sonata. And during the last World War,00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000what was our musical symbol for victory?00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000Pah-pah-pah-pah. Morse code: V for victory, which00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000is, as you know, Beethoven's Fifth. And00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000when a great man dies what do we play,00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000the funeral march from Beethoven's00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000Eroica. And on United Nations Day or00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000Brotherhood week, or whatever, what happens00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000to be what is the inevitable piece of00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000music? Beethoven's 9th. Or, even the00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000Beatles featured it in their film "Help."00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000And look at Schroeder in Peanuts: to him00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000Beethoven's birthday is more important00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000than 4th of July.00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000It's Beethoven, Beethoven, forever00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000Beethoven - the name that's almost become00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000a synonym for music itself. And who was00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000this giant with the magic name? Well, he00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000was a short stubby fellow, not Viennese00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000at all, not even Austrian, but German from00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000the town of born on the Rhine River00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000where he was born in 1770. And how did he00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000get to Vienna? Well, at the age of 22 he00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000was sent there by the local big-shots of00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000his home town,00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000since Vienna was the place for studying00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000music - and making a career in it. And so00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000this little provincial chap with bad00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000skin and a comedy accent from the00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000Rhineland arrived in Vienna, knocked them00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000all dead, and was taken out by the00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000Viennese nobility and made a hero. Before00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000long he was dominating the musical scene,00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000which he has continued to dominate ever00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000since - the mighty, the colossal, the00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000profound, the revolutionary, the mystic,00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000romantic Beethoven.00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000He was also, you should know, bad-tempered00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000stubborn, ill-mannered, messy, arrogant,00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000moody, and miserly. But out of this homely00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000human vessel, and a defective one at that,00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000since he had grown deaf by the time he00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000became 32 years old, but out of this00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000human vessel, spoke a voice that was more00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000than human - a voice with the ring and the00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000conviction of something eternal,00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000something that still today makes us00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000tingle with the sudden awareness that a00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000divine spark exists in every one of us.00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000Why should this be? I've been trying all00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000my life to find out. The very first00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000television program I ever did was00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000about Beethoven. Such an inquiry. The very00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000first chapter of my first book is called00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000"Why Beethoven?" Well, I'm still asking that00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000question, and I'll probably never find a00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000total answer. Mighty, colossal - these words00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000just don't explain anything. Because the00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000final answer is a mystery - the mystery of00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000why this one particular grubby,00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000shaggy-headed, little man should have00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000been chosen to wallop the galaxies with his music.00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000And so we shall have an all-Beethoven00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000program today, beginning, just as we began00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000125 years ago, with those four heaven-00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000storming notes that announce the first00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000movement of his Fifth Symphony.00:06:02.000 --> 00:07:58.000ORCH: SYMPHONY NO. 5 IN C MINOR ALLEGRO CON BRIO00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000Still the most fantastic music no matter00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000how often you hear it. And did you grasp00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000the shape of that movement? The perfect00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000definition, the exactness, of starts and00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000stops, of holding back and plunging ahead,00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000of the sudden mysterious drops and the00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000wild eruptions? Every split-second is00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000measured and molded by a master. Now00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000apropos of this shaping and molding,00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000there's an important thing that needs to00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000be said, and I'm going to try to say it,00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000even at the risk of possibly boring you00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000a little bit with a tiny lecture. You've00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000probably heard of a popular biography of00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000Beethoven called "The Man who Freed Music."00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000Now this title has always caused me a00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000certain disquiet. Because what does it00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000mean? Freed music from what? From Bach?00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000From Mozart? Haydn? Well hardly: I mean00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000they all had plenty of freedom of their00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000own. The truth is that all great composes00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000free music - not from the bondage of other00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000composers, but from routine, from00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000mediocrity, from second-rate, dusty00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000tradition; in other words, a great00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000composer frees music from the00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000predictable. Now take one of Beethoven's00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000most obvious examples of the00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000unpredictable - the famous opening tune of00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000his third Symphony, the Eroica. You know00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000that unit rides along in E-flat major on00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000the nice, expected notes of the tonic00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000triad and it goes like that for four bars00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000on just those notes and then on the00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000fifth bar the unexpected happens. So the00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000tune goes like this:00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000Bang! that D-flat! Surprise: the bondage of00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000the Triad is broken. Music is freed. But00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000freed by what? By a D-flat and that's00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000just the point:00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000It's a D-flat not a C-flat, not an A00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000natural but that one, chosen, limited note00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000D flat-00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000that's what did the freeing. Now doesn't00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000this tell us something very important00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000about the nature of freedom? Obviously00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000freedom must carry with it the meaning00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000of freedom to limit oneself, and one's00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000material. Freedom is not infinite, not00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000boundless liberty, as some hippies like00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000to think - do anything you want, any time,00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000anywhere you want to. No, freedom isn't00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000that, it means being free to make00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000decisions, to determine one's own course.00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000But decisions, deciding, means choosing,00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000and choosing is impossible without00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000rejecting. Now can you understand that?00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000You can't choose something without00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000rejecting all the other things you00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000haven't chosen. You see, if you choose one00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000apple out of a dozen, you automatically00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000unchoose the other eleven, and Beethoven00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000chose that one D-flat, he automatically00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000unchose all the other eleven notes. So00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000you see, real freedom must contain within00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000itself the freedom to un-choose, as well00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000as choose to censor oneself, to limit00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000oneself. And that is the whole meaning of00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000democracy, the kind of freedom on which00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000we base our hopes for a peaceful world -00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000just as it is the meaning of freedom in00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000great musical composition. In Beethoven,00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000as in democracy, freedom is a discipline,00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000combining the right to choose freely,00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000with the gift of choosing wisely. Now do00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000you see what I meant by Beethoven's00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000shaping of that movement? I hope so! End00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000of lecture. That, now we are going to hear00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000more of that great free discipline in00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000action - the last two movements of00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto in G00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000major. The first of these is the brief00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000but marvelous slow movement which has00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000often been compared to Orpheus taming00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000the beasts with his legendary musical00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000powers, the beast in this case is of00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000course the orchestra, which is loud and00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000angry and rough, and Orpheus is the solo00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000piano, soft and tender. In this dialogue,00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000as the movement progresses the orchestra00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000is gradually reduced to a domesticated00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000whisper and then everything ends in a00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000happy final Rondo. Our Orpheus today is a00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000young artist who has the depth and power00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000to match this music, a 21-year old00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000Israeli named Joseph Kalichstein. He00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000will be accompanied by one of our young00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000assistant conductors,- Paul Capolongo,00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000a very gifted young Frenchman, who00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000was born and raised in of all places00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000Algiers. How wonderful that Beethoven's00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000music can bring together an Algerian and00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000an Israeli. And here they are00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000Joseph's Kalichstein and Paul Capolongo00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000Before that gorgeous Piano Concerto we00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000were talking about the connection00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000between Beethoven and freedom; and00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000nowhere is that connection more evident00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000than in Beethoven's opera Fidelio. This00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000is the only opera Beethoven ever wrote,00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000but he wrote it and rewrote it and00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000rewrote it over a period of 12 years.00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000This, of course, was typical of Beethoven00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000in his search for perfection; all his00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000works went through long agonies of00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000rewriting and scratching out and trying00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000again -that was the price he paid for his00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000freedom, the price of free choice - to make00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000the exactly right choice. But with his00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000opera Fidelio the agony was even worse,00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000and I think one of the main reasons was00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000that the story of the upper deals with00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000the very subject of freedom itself. To00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000the hero of the story as a young00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000Spaniard named Florestan, nothing to do with00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000toothpaste,00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000who has been unjustly imprisoned for00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000speaking out freely against tyranny. And00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000Florestan's loving wife, whose name is00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000Leonore, has managed to sneak into the00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000prison disguised as a boy, and gets a job00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000as the jailor's assistant so that she can00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000help her husband escape. So you have00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000Florestan and Leonore. So why in the00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000world is this opera called Fidelio? Well,00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000because that is the name Leonore it takes00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000in her disguise as a boy. And even here00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000with the title Beethoven wrestled with00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000his freedoms of choice: the Opera was00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000first called Fidelio then changed to00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000Leonore and then changed back again00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000to Fidelio. And the overture to the Opera00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000most clearly of all reflects the agony00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000of free choices: the Beethoven wasn't00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000satisfied until we had written four00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000different overtures to this opera. Three00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000of them are called overture to Leonore00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000numbers one, two, and three, respectively.00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000And the fourth is known as the overture00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000to Fidelio. Don't ask me to explain why,00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000it's too complicated. But of all the four,00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000it is the third Leonore overture that00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000is the masterpiece and the one we are00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000going to play now. This is a massive work -00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000it's more than just an overture, rather00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000like a great symphonic poem00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000describing the whole opera. During its slow00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000introduction we feel the heavy, brooding00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.000atmosphere of Florestan's dungeon, and00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000then, when the main fast section begins,00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000we hear the gradually rising hope of00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000rescue surging up through the orchestra,00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000and the excitement is made even more00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000dramatic by alternating with moods of00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000prayer and of love music. At the climax00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000the orchestra suddenly cuts off, and the00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000famous trumpet-call of liberation sounds00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000in the distance announcing the arrival00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000of the rescue party. You'll hear it00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000coming from somewhere backstage there.00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000And then there is a moment of hushed00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000suspense,00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000then again the trumpet-call, nearer this00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000time, and finally it arrived, the triumphant00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000achievement of freedom, in a brilliant00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000coda of celebration. So as you listen now00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000to this essay on Liberty, you can00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000understand why Beethoven has always00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000meant so much to us and will continue to00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000as long as the human race struggles for00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000freedom.00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center,00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000another in the series of New York00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000Philharmonic Young People's Concerts00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000under the musical direction of Leonard00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000Bernstein, has presented  aprogram titled00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000Forever Beethoven. Joseph Kalichstein00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000was the soloist and Paul Capolongo00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.000conducted two movements of the Piano00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000Concerto Number Four in G major. Mr.00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000Bernstein and the orchestra performed00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000the first movement of the Fifth symphony00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000in C minor and the Leonore Overture Number00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:59.000Three. This program, which concludes the00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.00011th season of New York Philharmonic00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000Young People's Concerts, was recorded in00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000Philharmonic Hall and was produced and00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:17.000directed by Roger Englander.00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000This special program has been brought to00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000you by Polaroid corporation.
