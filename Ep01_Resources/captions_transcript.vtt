00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:28.000  
<v ANNOUNCER: (V.0)> (ON CUE) 
Carnegie Hall in New York City, the home of the world's greatest musical events.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:36.795  
Today's event is one in a series of New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts 

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.511
under the musical direction of Leonard Bernstein. 

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.498
(ON CUE . .) and here is Mr. Bernstein.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.090
<v BERNSTEIN> Gimme that spray.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.557
The kind that you spray.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.103
Oh, there's no time?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:55.087
No time?

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:56.586
Alright then.

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:59.240
Okay

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.915
<v BERNSTEIN> O.K., now what do you think that music's all about? 

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:15.914
Can you tell me?

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.605
That's just what I thought you'd say..... 

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:26.351
cowboys, bandits, horses, the wild west

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:32.636
I know my little daughter Jamie who's five years old and who's sitting up there agrees with you.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:34.783
When she heard me play this piece, she said -

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:38.015
"Ooo the Lone Ranger song, Hi-ho Silver!"

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.529
Well, I hate to disappoint her,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.576
and you too,

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.565
but it really isn't about the Lone Ranger at all.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:46.962
It's about notes - 

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:50.210
E flats and F sharps.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:56.229
You see, no matter how many times people tell you stories about what music means,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.759
forget them.

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:01.077
Stories are not what the music means ab-at all.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.825
Music is never about anything.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.426
Music just is.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.764
Music is notes; Beautiful notes and sounds put together in such a way that we get pleasure out of listening to them,

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:14.841
that's all there is to it.

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.238
And when we ask "What does it mean - 

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.158
what does this piece of music mean?", 

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.828
then we're asking a very hard question. 

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.295
And that's the question we're going to try to answer today. 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.432
Now:

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.649
It's a funny thing about this meaning business -

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.984
in music, anyway.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.919
When you say "What does it mean?",

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.348
you're really saying is

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:39.348
"What is it trying to tell me?",

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.096
"What ideas

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:42.595
does it make me have?".

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:44.133
Just like words;

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.421
when you hear words, you get ideas from them.

00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:47.966
If I say to you, 

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:49.684
"Ow, I burned my finger!",

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.923
then immediately you get an idea from what I said or some ideas, you get

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:56.359
the idea that I burned my finger,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:57.507
that it hurts,

00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:00.504
that I might not be able to play the piano any more,

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:04.158
or that I have a loud ugly voice when I scream - 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.219
lots of different ideas like that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.296
That's words.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.490
But if I play you notes,

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.175
just notes on the piano like that-

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.814
those notes don't tell you any ideas;

00:04:16.564 --> 00:04:18.711
those notes aren't about burning your finger,

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:21.740
or sputniks, or lampshades, 

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:23.637
or rockets, or anything.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.034
Well what ARE they about?

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
They're about music.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
For instance, 

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.804
take this piece by Chopin. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.563
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:42.709
But what's it about? 

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:43.888
Nothing.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.348
Or take this Beethoven Sonata-

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.898
it's not about anything, either.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.818
Or take this piece of boogie-woogie. 

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.004
that's not about anything either.

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.612
They're NONE of them about anything!

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.993
But they're all fun to listen to.

00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:15.421
Why should they be fun to listen to?

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:16.998
I don't know it's just,

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:20.222
part of human nature to like to listen to music. 

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.150
You see, notes aren't like words at all.

00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:27.639
Because if I say one single word all by itself to you,

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.474
like "rocket", 

00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:32.956
immediately you have an idea you see a picture in your mind.

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:35.719
Rocket: Bang! Picture.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.913
But if I play a note; one note all alone, 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.349
that means nothing. 

00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:45.057
It's just a plain old F sharp or a B flat.

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.727 
A sound, that's all, higher or lower,

00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:51.583 
louder or softer - a sound that can seem very different

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:52.848 
if I play it,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:54.816 
or I sing it

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.751 
or if an oboe plays it

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.975 
or if a xylophone plays it

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.410 
or if a trombone plays it

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:09.352
Very different. 

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:11.484 
It's all the same note -

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:13.545
only with a different sound.

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:17.773
Now all music is, is a combination of sounds

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:19.165
like that one and that one

00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:20.309
and that one and that one

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.266
all put together according to a plan.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:30.028
And the guy who plans it is called the composer - whether he's named Richard Rodgers or Rimsky-Korsakov, he's the composer

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.417
and his plan

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:38.882
is to put the sounds together with rhythms and different instruments and voices - or whatever

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:40.153
in such a way

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:47.032
that what finally comes out is exciting, or fun, or touching, or interesting, or all of those together.

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.168
That's called music; and it has a musical meaning,

00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:53.234
which has nothing to do with any stories or pictures

00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:54.697
or anything like that.

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.452
Of course if there is a story connected to the music,

00:06:58.036 --> 00:06:58.627
okay;

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.931
some times its good in a way, it would give an extra meanirg to the music;

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:06.227
but it's extra -- remember that.

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:08.921
And so, whatever the music means, it's not the story.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.415
Well what does it mean? That's what we're going to find out.

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:20.223
Now let's take the first step to finding out-Remember that piece we played at the beginning? Diggy-Dum Digg-Dum Diggy-Dum-Bum-Bum! That wild-west piece of music.

00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:24.145
Well, for one thing it can't mean the Wild West,

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:28.682
for the simple reason that it was written by a a fellow who never heard of the Wild West -

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.195
an Italian named Rossini.

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:36.573
Now we think his music means cowboys, and horses, and the Wild West

00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:40.254
because we've been told so by so many movies and television shows.

00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:42.728
But Rossini really wrote this piece

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.950
as an overture to an opera called "William Tell",

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.580
which is about people in Switzerland, which is pretty far from the Wild West. 

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:56.697
Well then, maybe the music is supposed to be about William Tell and Switzerland, instead of about cowboys.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:58.409
Is that what it's about?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.736
No! 

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:06.681
It's not about William Tell or cowboys or lampshades or rockets or anything,

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:11.257
Then what makes it so exciting? Well, there are a million reasons:

00:08:12.432 --> 00:08:15.779
but they're all musical reasons, THAT's the main point.

00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:17.942
For instances take the rhythm

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.684
Diga-da Diga-da Diga-da-da-da

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.067
which is like the rhythm of galloping horses 

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.362
or like the rhythm of drums in a battle,

00:08:28.572 --> 00:08:33.382
but that doesn't mean that the music is about drums or horses or battles;

00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:37.288
the meaning is only the excitement of that rhythm, you see?

00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:41.343
Now another reason it's exciting is that it has a mighty fine tune,

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:44.782
one that's easy to remember and stirs your blood;

00:08:45.763 --> 00:08:47.265
it starts with a phrase going up

00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:50.704
and answers itself with a phrase going down.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.114
It's like a question and answer.

00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.557
Or maybe it's more like an argument,

00:08:56.627 --> 00:08:58.119
with the second person winning it.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:03.108
Uh, lets ha-try and have that argument now, you and me and see who wins.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.949
I'm going to sing the first phrase,

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:09.327
diga-dum diga-dum diga-dum-dum-dum and you'11 argue back

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:11.934
with the second phrase. Diga-dum diga-bum bum bum bum bum

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:14.720
Then I'm going to argue back with again with the third phrase diga-dum diga-du diga-duh-duh-duh

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.743
and you're gonna wind it up with the fourth phrase. Diga-Daa diga-bup-bup-bup

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:21.918
O.K.? Ready, go!

00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:29.405
You win! 

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:34.790
You see? You see how exciting that last phrase is?

00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:37.708
It has all the excitement and triumph of 

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:40.502
winning an argument. It makes you feel good.

00:09:41.607 --> 00:09:44.144
But there are still more reasons why this music is exciting;

00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:47.871
for instance, the way it's played, the instruments that play it,

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:50.136
like those trumpets at the beginning,

00:09:55.443 --> 00:10:03.568
or the violins, who use their bows in a jumping way to make that galloping sound, takata takata takata takata. Would you show us Mr. Corligliano?

00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:10.035
You see? Now when all the strings do it together, it really gallops! Watch.

00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:21.537
So you see, this music is exciting because it was written to be exciting,

00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:25.661
for musical reasons and no other reasons.

00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:28.361
Well, if all that's true,

00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:32.019
then why does a composer put names on his music at all?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.832
Why doesn't he just write something called Symphony or Trio

00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:40.922
or composition Number nine hundred and fifty twelve or anything?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.727
Why does he give his music a name, like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice",

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.003
or whatever it happens to be,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.027
if it's not important to the music?

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:52.688
Well, every once in a while an artist is stimulated to

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:54.221
express himself

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:00.423
by something outside himself --something he reads, or something he sees, or something that's happened to him.

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:03.365
Haven't you ever felt like that  -that you wanted to

00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:11.738
dance or sing because something happened to you that made you want to dance or sing and express your feelings in some way? I'm sure that you've all had that feeling.

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.361
Well, it's the same with a composer;

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:18.291
For instance, Johann Strauss wrote lots of waltzes,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.291
and one of them goes like this:

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:23.840
Do you know the name of this one?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
<v KIDS:> The Blue Danube! 

00:11:26.074 --> 00:11:27.545
<v BERNSTEIN:> Right! The Blue Danube.

00:11:28.222 --> 00:11:34.922
Now, maybe the Danube River inspired Strauss to write that waltz. I don't know I have my doubts.

00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:39.839
But in any case those notes don't have anything to do with the Danube River do they?

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:40.750
<v KIDS:> No.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.423
<v BERNSTEIN> Now what's this.. one? 

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:47.730
--what?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.046
<v KIDS:> Response.

00:11:49.957 --> 00:11:51.677
<v BERNSTEIN:> Right. Tales of the Vienna Woods.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:54.454
Well why couldn't that one be called "By The Blue Danube"

00:11:55.217 --> 00:12:01.568
or "The Emperor Waltz" or "The Tennesse Waltz" or "The Missouri Waltz" for that matter what's the difference?

00:12:02.182 --> 00:12:05.808
A Strauss waltz by any other name is still just a lovely waltz.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.481
The name doesn't matter, except to help you take..tell one waltz apart from the other,

00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:16.641
and maybe give the music a little more color, like a sort-of fancy dress costume.

00:12:17.684 --> 00:12:19.396
Well now I'm going to try a trick with you.

00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:24.096
We're going to play you a piece that has a story, a very good story,

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.789
but I'm going to tell you the wrong story.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:31.543
I'm just going to make one up out of my head, that doesn't belong to this music at all,

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.734
and I'm not going to tell you the real name of this piece;

00:12:35.652 --> 00:12:39.800
and you see if the story and the music don't go together just as well

00:12:40.477 --> 00:12:42.018
as if it were the real story.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.734
O.K., here goes.

00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:48.438
In the middle of a big city

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:52.757
there stands an enormous jail, full of prisoners.

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.757
It's midnight and all the prisoners are asleep

00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:01.707
except for one who can't sleep because he was put in jail unjustly.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.854
And he spends the whole night

00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:06.057
practicing on his kazoo

00:13:06.423 --> 00:13:09.963
while all the other prisoners are sleeping and snoring around him.

00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:14.090
You all know what a kazoo is? Well.

00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:16.384
This kazoo-playing prisoner

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:22.843
has a friend who is going to come and rescue him tonight, and this friend's name is

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:24.158
Superman.

00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:30.197
So, Superman comes charging down through the alley on his motorcycle.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.854
Then he whistles his secret whistle so that his friend the prisoner will know he's coming.

00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:47.481
Now, as he gets nearer the prison,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.348
he hears all the prisoners snoring away peacefully in the dead silence of the night.

00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:11.663
And over this snoring he hears his friend playing on his kazoo.

00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:14.480
which gets louder as he gets nearer.

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:35.398
Suddenly, he charges into the prison yard and bops the guard over the head.

00:14:38.931 --> 00:14:43.429
The kazoo stops playing, and with all the snoring still going on,

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:47.538
he grabs his friend and whisks him away on his motorcycle!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.604
The snoring gets farther, and farther away, until we don't hear it at all anymore.

00:15:07.787 --> 00:15:10.636
And our hero arrives at last to freedom!

00:15:25.243 --> 00:15:26.262
That's the story.

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:32.628
Now let's hear how this story sounds all put together, and remember to keep this story in your mind.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:34.371
Here goes.

00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:10.664
Now all that makes good sense, doesn't it?

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:19.664
Makes perfectly good sense. But that's not the real story at all.

00:17:20.963 --> 00:17:27.057
What this piece really is, is a part of a much longer piece by Richard Strauss called "Don Quixote."

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:33.547
And in it Strauss was trying to tell a whole other story which goes something like this:

00:17:34.714 --> 00:17:40.582
Don Quixote is the name of a silly old man, back in the days of knights and armour and horseback -

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:49.493
a foolish old man who read too many books about knighthood and chivalry and conquering armies for his beautiful lady and all that sort of nonsense,

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.925
and who finally decided he was a marvelous knight himself.

00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:56.629
So off he goes on his skinny, bony old horse,

00:17:57.096 --> 00:17:58.294
to conquer the world.

00:18:02.084 --> 00:18:07.602
And he has with him a companion named Sancho Panza, a little fat, jolly 
fellow,

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:13.547
who is very faithful to his master, but is also sensible enough to know his master is a little cuckoo.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.298
So we hear him laughing at old Don Quixote.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:28.294
Suddenly, Don Quixote spies a flock of sheep in the middle of a field going Baa-baa

00:18:29.547 --> 00:18:32.668
That's all that stuff you heard before which we thought was snoring.

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:38.466
And with them is a sheperd keeping the sheep and playing on his pipe, the way all shepherds do.

00:18:40.715 --> 00:18:43.392
Not a kazoo, but a shepherd's pipe.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:51.454
And Don Quixote in his mixed up mind, thinks that the sheep are an army specially put there for him to conquer,

00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:54.326
so in he charges with his sword flashing.

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.758
And the sheep run off in all directions, baa-ing wildly.

00:19:02.715 --> 00:19:07.695
And he is convinced he has done a truly knightly deed, and is he proud!

00:19:11.742 --> 00:19:17.727
Now, lets listen to it all over again with the real story in mind and see how it sounds.

00:20:47.431 --> 00:20:50.902
Now was that music any different from what we played before?

00:20:52.085 --> 00:20:52.832
Was it?

00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:53.937
<v KIDS:> "NO!"

00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.642
<v BERNSTEIN> Is it more exciting or more fun, or better music? No.

00:20:58.062 --> 00:21:02.513
Does it have any different musical meaning? No. It's exactly the same, 

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.521
only the story is different.

00:21:04.614 --> 00:21:09.891
And in fact, there are a hundred other stories I could have made up out of my head for the same piece of music.

00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:16.918
But the music would still have been just as good or just as bad as it is without any story at all.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.692
Now do you see what I mean?

00:21:20.599 --> 00:21:24.490
Well if you don't, then I'm going to have to try again.

00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:28.910
I'll take another little bit of this Don Quixote piece of Strauss.

00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:37.114
Later in that same piece, there is a part about another adventure the old fellow has, when he and his friend Sancho Panza 

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.607
take a wild ride through the air on a wooden horse.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:43.011
It goes like this:

00:21:49.463 --> 00:21:53.299
Now in this part there is even a wind-machine in the percussion section

00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:58.327
to give you the effect of the wind whistling by as they whoosh up and down through the clouds.

00:22:03.338 --> 00:22:04.210
Now:

00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:08.444
Why couldn't this music be describing the flight of a jet plane?

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.195
or a satellite whistling around in its orbit:

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:17.700
or maybe some old giant snoring like the prisoners in the jail?

00:22:17.377 --> 00:22:18.000
Going: 

00:22:21.432 --> 00:22:26.296
Well, now let's make believe it is about some old giant snoring, and see how the music fits.

00:23:34.771 --> 00:23:36.203
Now isn't that exciting music?

00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:39.923
That no matter what it's about; it's still exciting

00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:43.829
because the music is exciting, and for no other reason.

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:54.016
Now, that's enough talk about music that tells stories. Let's take a big step now toward finding out the answer to our first question: "What does music mean?"

00:23:55.028 --> 00:23:59.050
by listening to some music that deesn't try to tell a story, but only tries

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:06.343
to paint a picture, in a general sort of way, or to describe an atmosphere. The look of something,

00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:12.195
the feel of something - like a night in the woods, or an old haunted house, or a sunrise.

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:19.619
Now we're getting closer to real musical meaning, because we don't have a story to worry about while we're listening.

00:24:19.962 --> 00:24:22.903
You see, all we have to think of is the general idea,

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:28.071
And that's easier so we can concentrate more on the music and enjoy it more.

00:24:29.207 --> 00:24:32.413
Now, for instance take Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:38.125
Here's a wonderful piece, full of charming tunes and marvelous rhythms, driving,

00:24:38.405 --> 00:24:43.542
peaceful, happy - all kinds of things. But in Beethoven's mind

00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:47.946
this symphony was somehow tied up with the idea of the countryside -

00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:55.153
farmers, brooks, shepherds, birds. And so he called it the Pastoral Symphony - as you know, pastoral means

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.114
anything to do with the country.

00:24:58.001 --> 00:25:00.429
At the beginning of the first movement

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:06.546
he wrote the words:	"Awakening of cheerful feelings on arriving in the country";

00:25:07.153 --> 00:25:08.600
and the music goes like this:

00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:20.522
Sounds happy, cheerful, pretty, alright.

00:25:21.129 --> 00:25:24.787
But these feelings, after all, could be happy for any other reason, too;

00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:30.779
supposing Beethoven had written the words "Happy feelings because my uncle left me a million dollars,"

00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:34.997
or "Happy feelings because my bellyache went away" -

00:25:35.978 --> 00:25:40.756
he could still have written this happy music, and it would be just as good, just as happy.

00:25:41.394 --> 00:25:47.418
Well now let's try something; let's change the title of this piece, and call it

00:25:48.118 --> 00:25:52.258
"Happy feelings because my bellache went away" let's say 

00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:57.379
- and let let's listen to it with that in mind and see if it sounds any different.

00:26:58.624 --> 00:27:03.636
It's still the same happy music, whether it's about your bellyache or a trip to the country.

00:27:04.897 --> 00:27:09.255
Now the second movement, Beethoven calls "By the Brook."

00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:15.792
And in this movement he is trying to describe or imitiate or suggest

00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:18.702
the motion of water in the brook.

00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:29.161
But supposing we call this "Asleep in the Hammock,"

00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:35.979
and that this motion we're describing gently rocking back and forth in a hammock instead of the water - 

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.173
let's see how the music would sound then.

00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:17.772
See it doesn't change a thing, does it?

00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:22.401
Whether it's about water or sweening in a hammock? It's the same lovely music.

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:30.353
Now one of the best pieces that paint 
pictures is by a Russian composer called Mussorgsky.

00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:34.294
He wrote a piece named "Pictures at an Exhibition." 

00:29:34.787 --> 00:29:40.456
What he did was to take a lot of pictures hanging on a wall in a museum and 

00:29:34.787 --> 00:29:40.456
write music that he thought could describe them - 

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:48.332
in other words, to try and do with notes what the painter does with paint. 

00:29:48.678 --> 00:29:51.920
Now of course notes can't do what paint can do; 

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.954
you can't draw your nose with F sharps, 

00:29:54.986 --> 00:29:58.778
and you can't draw a building or paint a sunset with notes. 

00:29:59.379 --> 00:30:03.335
But you can sort of try do it. 

00:30:03.353 --> 00:30:05.760
Anyway. Here's one of those pictures he tried to do it with; --

00:30:06.088 --> 00:30:08.768
--it shows children playing in a park; 

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.576
and what Mussorgsky did to make it sound like children playing 

00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:17.354
was to imitate the way children talk when they play games 

00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:20.818
- almost like singing. You know when you go in a game.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.935
ALLEE ALLEE IN FREE. ALLEE ALLEE IN FREE.

00:30:23.935 --> 00:30:25.795
There's a kind of tune you're singing.

00:30:25.795 --> 00:30:29.277 
Or when kids are taunting each other, making fun of each other when they play

00:30:29.277 --> 00:30:32.595 
and they go (SING-) "Nya nya, nya nya."

00:30:32.596 --> 00:30:37.595
Mussorgsky took this nya nya nya nya and watch how he uses it

00:31:44.312 --> 00:31:49.016
Nya, Nya. You see how he uses this almost to paint children with notes?

00:31:50.656 --> 00:31:54.831
Then there's another picture Mussorgsky painted with notes; 

00:31:54.795 --> 00:31:58.459
of many little chickens not yet out of their egg-shells,

00:31:58.495 --> 00:32:05.514
who do a dance. All listen to how he describes chickens in notes, the way he imitates their pecking and squawking.

00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:14.844
And then, and then the final picture, the last one of the series; where he paints a big gate in the Russian city of Kiev -

00:33:15.154 --> 00:33:20.021
- a tremendous stone structure. And you can see what Mussorgsky had in his mind,

00:33:20.094 --> 00:33:27.240
when you hear these great big strong chords, like pillars holding up those tons of stone. Listen!

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:25.226
Now that made you think of a big gate, didn't it? Did it? Didn't it?

00:35:25.263 --> 00:35:25.974
<v KIDS> Yes!

00:35:25.263 --> 00:35:25.919
<v BERNSTEIN> OK!

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:31.880
but only because I told you beforehand to think of a gate.  

00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:38.480
If I had told you beforehand to think about the Mississippi River flowing majestically down the middle of America, 

00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:40.977
you would have had that in your mind when you heard these big chords.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:49.436
So again - there's the old answer; the picture that goes with music goes with it only because the composer SAYS so;

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:53.975
but it's not really part of the music. It's extra.

00:35:53.848 --> 00:35:58.825
Now we're going to take another giant step toward finding out the answer toward finding out our answer to what music means.

00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:05.497
And this is a really big step; we're getting closer now to the answer!

00:36:05.515 --> 00:36:13.245
Because now we're going to forget about all those pieces that try to tell stories or paint pictures- we've had enough of that 

00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:19.698
- and we're going to listen to music that describes emotions, feelings 

00:36:19.735 --> 00:36:26.954
- like pain, happiness, loneliness, anger, love.

00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:29.470 
I guess most music is like that; 

00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:35.322
and the better it is, the more it will make you feel those emotions that the composer felt when he was writing it. 

00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:45.640
Tchaikovsky was a composer who always tried to do this - who always tried to have his music mean something easily recognized as emotional. 

00:36:45.968 --> 00:36:49.085
Take this part of his 4th Symphony for instance ---

00:37:00.498 --> 00:37:08.792
I guess the best way to describe that would be by saying that it has the feeling of wanting something very badly that you can't have. 

00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:13.423
Did you ever feel you wanted something more than anything else in the world; 

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:18.163
and you said so, and they said no you can't have it, and you said again - "I want it!" 

00:37:18.144 --> 00:37:24.306
And again they said no, and again you said, louder and more excited, "I want it!" and again, louder "I want it!"

00:37:24.762 --> 00:37:31.161
until it seemed that something would break in your head and there's nothing left to do but cry? 

00:37:31.163 --> 00:37:33.020
Well, that's like this music. Listen!

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:08.770
And finally something breaks in your head:

00:38:13.054 --> 00:38:14.403
and you cry.

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:20.164
Now listen to the orchestra play it now, and see if you don't feel something like those emotions.

00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:12.667  
Pretty emotional stuff isn't it?

00:39:14.044 --> 00:39:21.667  
Well now sometimes Tchaikovsky uses the same tune to describe two different emotions. 

00:39:22.238 --> 00:39:28.163  
For instance, at the beginning of his 5th Symphony he writes this tune,

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:32.082  
which sounds sad and gloomy and depressed.

00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:16.454 
Pretty depressing. But at the end of the symphony, in the last movement, he changes a few notes 

00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:21.522
- what musicians call changing from minor to major,

00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:24.385
some of you will know what that means - and it all comes out joyful and triumphant, 

00:40:24.585 --> 00:40:30.109
like someone who has just made a touchdown and is the hero of the football game.

00:42:09.555 --> 00:42:24.978
Didn't you feel triumphant? Didn't, didn't that make you feel like the winner, at least of a football game, maybe of a presidential election.

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:32.343
Now we can really understand what the meaning of music is; it's the way it makes you feel when you hear it. 

00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:39.051
Finally, we've taken that last giant step, and we're there, we know what music means now. 

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:46.015
And we don't have to know a lot of stuff about sharps and flats and chords, and all that business, in order to understand music; 

00:42:46.307 --> 00:42:52.307
if it tells us something - not a story or a picture - but a feeling 

00:42:52.797 --> 00:43:01.712
- if it makes us change inside, and have all those different good feelings music can make you have, then you're understanding it. 

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:08.165
And that's all there is to it. Because those feelings aren't like the stories and pictures we talked about before;

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.631
they're not extra; they're not outside the music; they belong to the music;

00:43:13.506 --> 00:43:15.512
they're what music is about.

00:43:16.132 --> 00:43:23.934
And the most wonderful thing of all is that there's no limit to the different kinds of feelings music can make you have. 

00:43:23.825 --> 00:43:30.400
And some of those feelings are so special and so deep that they can't even be described in words. 

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:32.812
You see, we can't always name the things we feel.

00:43:32.812 --> 00:43:39.284
Sometimes we can. We can say we feel joy, pleasure, peacefulness, whatever, love, hate.

00:43:39.302 --> 00:43:46.139
But, every once in a while, we have feelings that are so deep and special that we have no words for them 

00:43:46.175 --> 00:43:49.147
and that's where music is so marvellous;

00:43:49.165 --> 00:43:54.360
because music names the feelings for us, only in notes instead of in words. 

00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:58.663
It's all in the way music moves - you must never forget that music is movement,

00:43:58.754 --> 00:43:58.772
always going somewhere, shifting and changing, and flowing, 

00:44:02.947 --> 00:44:04.879
from one note to another; 

00:44:05.007 --> 00:44:10.116
and that movement can tell us more about the way we feel than a million words can. 

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:15.271
Here we are going to play you a tiny little piece by a modern composer named Webern,

00:44:16.528 --> 00:44:21.104
who writes music that's so special in its sound and in it's meaning

00:44:21.122 --> 00:44:26.026
that a lot of people don't understand it all and just call it crazy modern music.

00:44:26.737 --> 00:44:32.261
But I know that very often young people can understand this kind of music better than older people. 

00:44:32.863 --> 00:44:39.043
So I'd like to take a chance and play it for you, crazy as it is. And see what you think of it.

00:45:39.075 --> 00:46:00.951
That's pretty special stuff, isn't it? You see if you even sneeze or cough you're liable to miss it. It's so delicate and so deep inside that you musn't even breath while it's going on. What did you think of it? Did you think it was ugly? It was funny? Think it was pretty? Did it make you have feelings? Well that's wonderful.

00:46:00.951 --> 00:46:03.212
Because that's just the wonder of music, 

00:46:03.157 --> 00:46:07.806
that it can make you have, different people have, different kinds of feelings.

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:12.363
For instance.... if I play a note on the piano, just one note

00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:16.702
-- and I hold it a long time -- that has no meaning at all, has it?

00:46:17.504 --> 00:46:22.773
But let's say I play it and then I moved to another note

00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:27.385
--- right away there's a meaning - a meaning we can't name, 

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:33.401
a sort of stretch, or pulling, or pushing, something like that - but it's there.

00:46:33.365 --> 00:46:38.979
And the meaning is in the way those two notes move, and it makes something happen inside of you. 

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.646
If I move from that first note to another note, like this ----

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.423
---- the meaning changes - something else happens inside of you 

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:52.543
- the stretch is bigger, somehow, and stronger.

00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:54.564
Now this note, for instance ---

00:46:54.697 --> 00:46:57.902
----means one thing with this chord under it --

00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:05.030 
and it makes you feel a certain way----and it means something completely different with this chord under it.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.361
And it makes you feel another way.

00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:11.812
Then with this chord under it, it means something else.

00:47:13.745 --> 00:47:14.820
Or with this chord.

00:47:15.987 --> 00:47:20.180
And each way, each different chord makes you feel a different way.

00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:22.987
Now, what about these notes --- Do you know what they are?

00:47:25.303 --> 00:47:26.506
<v KIDS> DRAGNET

00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:32.813
<v BERNSTEIN> Right. Okay. Well, now they mean something exciting and spooky is going to happen, 

00:47:32.868 --> 00:47:38.501
like "Dragnet"; but if I take the same notes played in just play them in a different way, they'll mean something else --

00:47:44.681 --> 00:47:47.835
Silly. Just light and silly. And they're the same notes!

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:55.474
So you see, the meaning of music is in music. It's in the melodies, and the rhythms, and the harmonies, 

00:47:55.692 --> 00:48:01.891
And the way it's orchestrated. And most important of all, in the way it develops itself. 

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.409
But that's a whole other program. We'll talk about it some other time. 

00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:12.811
Right now, all you have to know is that music has its own meanings, right there for you to find inside the music itself.

00:48:12.738 --> 00:48:16.493
And you don't need any stories or any pictures to tell you what it is. 

00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:22.600
If you like music at all, you'll find out the meanings for yourselves, just by listening to it; 

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.486
So now, I want you all to listen to a short piece without any explanation from anybody.

00:48:27.741 --> 00:48:32.600
I'm not going to tell you anything about it, except the name of it and who wrote it, 

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.880
And you just all sit back and relax, and enjoy it, and listen to the notes, 

00:48:39.135 --> 00:48:46.628
and feel them move around, jumping, and hopping, and bumping, and flashing, and sliding, and whatever they do.

00:48:46.573 --> 00:48:52.534
And just enjoy THAT without a whole lot of fuss about stories and pictures and all that business.

00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:57.256
Now the piece we're going to play for you is by Ravel and it's called "La Valse".

00:48:57.383 --> 00:49:08.467
I think you'll like it because it's fun to listen to - and not for any other reason - not because it's about anything. It's just good, exciting music.
