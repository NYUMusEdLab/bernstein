00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:28.000  
<v ANNOUNCER: (V.0)> (ON CUE) From the home of the world's greatest musical events - Carnegie Hall, on 57th Street in New York City

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:36.795  
CBS presents for the first time on television, the New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts 

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.511
under the musical direction of Leonard Bernstein. 

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.498
(ON CUE . .) and here is Mr. Bernstein.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.915
<v BERNSTEIN> O.K., what do you think that music is all about? 

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.605
That's just what I thought you'd say..... 

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:26.351
cowboys and bandits and horses.

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:32.636
I know my little five-year-old daughter Jamie agrees with you.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:34.783
When she heard me play this piece, she said -

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:38.015
"That's the Lone Ranger song, Hi-ho Silver!"

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.529
Well, I hate to disappoint her,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.576
and you too,

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.565
but it isn't about the Lone Ranger at all.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:46.962
It's about notes - 

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:50.210
E Flats and F sharps.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:56.229
No matter how many times people tell you stories about what music means,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.759
forget them.

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:01.077
Stories are not what the music means at all.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.825
Music is never about things.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.426
Music just is.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.764
It's a lot of beautiful notes and sounds put together so well that we get pleasure out of hearing them,

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:14.841
that's all.

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.238
When we ask "What does it mean - 

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.158
what does this piece of music mean?", 

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.828
we're asking a hard question. 

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.295
And that's the question we're going to try to answer today. 

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.649
It's a funny thing about this meaning business -

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.984
in music, anyway.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.919
When you say "What does it mean?",

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.348
you're really saying 

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:39.348
"What is it trying to tell me?",

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.096
or "What ideas

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:42.595
does it make me have?".

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:44.133
Just like words;

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.421
when you hear words, you get ideas from them.

00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:47.966
If I say to you 

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:49.684
"Ow, I burned my finger!",

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.923
then you understand certain things right away;

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:56.359
that I burned my finger,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:57.507
that it hurts,

00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:00.504
that I might not be able to play the piano any more,

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:04.158
that I have a loud ugly voice - 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.219
lots of different ideas like that.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.490
But if I play you some notes

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.175
on the piano, like this-

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.814
the notes don't tell you any ideas;

00:04:16.564 --> 00:04:18.711
these notes aren't about burning your finger,

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:21.740
or sputniks, or lampshades, 

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:23.637
or anything.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.034
What ARE they about?

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
They're about music.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
For instance, 

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.804
take this piece by Chopin. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.563
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:42.709
But what's it about? 

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:43.888
Nothing.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.348
Or this Beethoven Sonata-

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.898
it's not about anything, either.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.818
Or this boogie-woogie. 

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.004
What's it about? Nothing. 

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.612
They're all about nothing,

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.993
but they're all fun to listen to.

00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:15.421
Why should they be fun to listen to?

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:16.998
I don't know; it's a

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:20.222
part of human nature to like to listen to music. 

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.150
You see, notes aren't like words at all.

00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:27.639
Because if I say even one single word all by itself,

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.474
like "rocket", 

00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:32.956
it means something; you get an idea right away; you see a picture in your mind. 

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:34.882
Rocket: Bang! 

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.913
But a note; one note all alone 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.349
means nothing. 

00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:45.057
It's just a plain old F sharp or a B flat.

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.727 
A sound, that's all, higher or lower,

00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:51.583 
louder or softer - a sound that can seem very different

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:52.848 
if I play it,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:54.816 
or I sing it

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.751 
or if an oboe plays it

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.975 
or a xylophone - 

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.410 
or a trombone

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:11.484 
It's all the same note -

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:13.545 
but with different sounds.

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:17.773
Now all music is a combination of 
sounds 

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:19.165
like this one

00:06:19.165 --> 00:06:20.309
or this one

00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:23.266
put together according to a plan.

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:30.028
The guy who plans it is the composer - whether he's called Rimsky-Korsakov or Richard Rodgers

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.417
and his plan

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:38.882
is to put the sounds together with rhythms and different instruments or voices -

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:40.153
in such a way

00:06:40.596 --> 00:06:47.032
that what finally 
comes out is exciting, or fun, or touching, or interesting, or all of these together.

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:50.168
That's called music; and what it means

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.300
<i>SKIPPED is what the composer planned; but it's a musical plan, so it has a musical meaning, and </i>

00:06:50.627 --> 00:06:53.234
has nothing to do with any stories or pictures

00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:54.697
or anything like that.

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.452
Of course if there is a story connected with a piece of music,

00:06:58.036 --> 00:06:58.627
okay;

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.931
in a way, it gives an extra meanirg to the music;

00:07:03.048 --> 00:07:06.227
but it's extra -- like mustard with your hot dog. Mustard isn't part of the hot dog, is it? Well the story isn't part of the music, either. 

00:07:09.841 --> 00:07:12.394
And so, whatever the music really mean?, it's not the story. We've got to find the real meaning in the music itself, in the way the notes are put together by the composer. 

00:07:13.476 --> 00:07:20.223
Now let's take that piece we played at the beginning. Remember?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.400
<i>SKIPPED A lot of people, like my little daughter,
think it means the Lone Ranger, horses,
cowboys, bandits, guns. A wild west piece
of music.</i> 

00:07:21.678 --> 00:07:24.145
Well, it can't mean the Wild West,

00:07:24.845 --> 00:07:28.682
for the simple reason that it was written
by a fellow who never heard of
the Wild West -

00:07:29.382 --> 00:07:31.195
an Italian named Rossini.

00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:36.573
We think his music means horses and cowboys

00:07:36.814 --> 00:07:40.254
because we've been told so by the movies and television shows.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.400
<i>SKIPPED So we get into the habit of thinking of his music and of cowboys at the same time - one makes us think of the other. But it wasn't written to be about cowboys.</i>

00:07:40.876 --> 00:07:42.728
Rossini really wrote it

00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:45.950
as an overture to an opera called "William Tell",

00:07:46.269 --> 00:07:50.580
which is about people in Switzerland, which is pretty far from the Wild West. 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:50.700
<i>SKIPPED You all know the story of William Tell, the man who had to shoot an apple off his little son's head with a bow and arrow - I'm sure you've heard the story. </i>

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:56.697
Well, then, maybe the music is supposed to be about William Tell and Switzerland, instead of about cowboys.

00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:58.409
Is that what it's about?

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.736
No! 

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:06.681
It's not about William Tell or cowboys or lampshades or rockets or anything,

00:08:07.693 --> 00:08:11.257
Then what makes it so exciting? Because of a million reasons:

00:08:12.432 --> 00:08:15.779
but they're musical reasons.

00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:17.942
For instances take the rhythm

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.067
which is like the rhythm of galloping horses 

00:08:24.074 --> 00:08:26.362
or like the rhythm of drums in a battle

00:08:28.572 --> 00:08:33.382
but that doesn't mean the music is about horses or drums;

00:08:33.771 --> 00:08:37.288
the meaning is only the excitement of that rhythm.

00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:41.343
Another reason it's exciting is that it has a good tune,

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:44.782
easy to remember; 

00:08:45.763 --> 00:08:47.265
it starts with a phrase going up

00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:50.704
and answers itself with a phrase going down.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.114
It's like a question and answer.

00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:56.557
Or maybe it's more like an argument,

00:08:56.627 --> 00:08:58.119
with the second person winning it.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.903
Let's have that argument now, you and me.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.949
I'll sing the first phrase,

00:09:07.786 --> 00:09:09.327
and you'11 argue back

00:09:09.638 --> 00:09:11.934
with the second phrase.

00:09:12.284 --> 00:09:14.720
Then I'll argue back with the third phrase

00:09:16.409 --> 00:09:18.743
and you'll wind it up with the last one. 

00:09:20.214 --> 00:09:21.918
O.K.? Ready, go!

00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:29.405
You win! 

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:34.790
You see what excitement there is on that last phrase - 

00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:37.708
it has all the triumph and good feeling of 

00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:40.502
winning an argument.

00:09:41.607 --> 00:09:44.144
But there are still more reasons why it's exciting;

00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:47.871
for instance, the way it's played, the instruments that play it,

00:09:48.611 --> 00:09:50.136
like the trumpets at the beginning,

00:09:55.443 --> 00:10:03.568
or the violins, who use their bows in a jumping way to make that galloping sound, takata, takata.

00:10:06.268 --> 00:10:10.035
And when all the violins do it together, it really gallops!

00:10:17.739 --> 00:10:21.537
So you see, this music is exciting because it's written to be exciting,

00:10:22.237 --> 00:10:25.661
not because of cowboys or William Tell's kid with an apple on his head. It's exciting for musical reasons, and no other reasons.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.100
<i>SKIPPED  So what the music means has to be found in the music, in the tunes, the orchestration, the rhythms - not in any story.</i>

00:10:26.665 --> 00:10:28.361
Well, if all that's true,

00:10:29.498 --> 00:10:32.019
then why does a composer put names on his music at all?

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.832
Why doesn't he just write something called Symphony or Trio

00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:40.922
or composition Number 28 or anything?

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.727
Why does he give his music a name, like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice",

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:46.003
or whatever it is,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.027
if it's not important to the music?

00:10:48.929 --> 00:10:52.688
Well every once in a while an artist will be stimulated to

00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:54.221
express himself

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:00.423
by something outside himself --something he reads, or that happens to him, or something he sees.

00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:03.365
Haven't you ever felt that way -that something happened to you that made you want to

00:11:04.338 --> 00:11:11.738
sing, or dance, or express your feelings in some way? Sure-- all of you know that feeling.

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:14.361
Well, it's the same with a composer;

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.500
<i>SKIPPED let's say he has just read a poem by Goethe called "The Sorcerer's Apprentice". And it struck him with such power that it made him feel like writing music. So he writes a piece called "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" -that's all. But the question isn't what the name of the piece is or whether it's about a Sorcerer or Mickey Mouse; the question is whether the music is good.</i>

00:11:15.054 --> 00:11:18.291
Johann Strauss wrote lots of waltzes,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.291
and one of them goes like this:

00:11:22.486 --> 00:11:23.840
For example, do you know the name of this one?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
<v KIDS:> The Blue Danube! 

00:11:35.669 --> 00:11:39.839
<v BERNSTEIN:> Now, does that have anything to do with the Danube River?

00:11:40.376 --> 00:11:40.750
<v KIDS:> No.

00:11:40.734 --> 00:11:42.423
<v BERNSTEIN> Now this is called 

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:47.730
--what?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.046
<v KIDS:> Response.

00:11:51.762 --> 00:11:54.454
<v BERNSTEIN:> Why couldn't that be called "The Blue Danube"

00:11:55.217 --> 00:11:58.400
or "The Emperor Waltz" or anything.

00:12:02.182 --> 00:12:05.808
A Strauss waltz by any other name is still just a lovely waltz.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.481
The name doesn't matter, except to help you tell one apart from the other,

00:12:11.917 --> 00:12:16.641
and maybe give the music a little more color, like a fancy dress costume.

00:12:17.684 --> 00:12:19.396
Now I'm going to try a trick with you.

00:12:20.493 --> 00:12:24.096
We're going to play a piece that has a story,

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.789
but I'm going to tell you the wrong story.

00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:31.543
I'm just going to make one up out of my head, 

00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:34.734
without telling you the real name of this piece;

00:12:35.652 --> 00:12:39.800
and you see if the story and the music don't go together just as well

00:12:40.477 --> 00:12:42.018
as if it were the real story.

00:12:43.559 --> 00:12:44.734
O.K., here goes.

00:12:47.022 --> 00:12:48.438
In the middle of a big city

00:12:49.909 --> 00:12:52.757
stands an enormous jail, full of prisoners

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.757
It's midnight and they're all asleep 

00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:01.707
except for one who can't sleep because he was put in jail unjustly.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:03.854
He spends the whole night

00:13:04.345 --> 00:13:06.057
practicing his kazoo

00:13:06.423 --> 00:13:09.963
while the other prisoners snore all around him.

00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:16.384
But this kazoo-playing prisoner

00:13:18.236 --> 00:13:22.843
has a friend who is going to come and rescue him -

00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:24.158
Superman!

00:13:25.675 --> 00:13:30.197
So Superman comes charging along through the alley on his motorcycle.

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:41.854
whistling his secret whistle so the prisoner will know he's coming.

00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:47.481
As he gets near the prison,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.348
he hears all the prisoners snoring away peacefully in the dead silence of the night.

00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:11.663
And he also hears his friend playing his kazoo over the snoring, 

00:14:12.207 --> 00:14:14.480
which gets louder as he gets nearer.

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:35.398
Suddenly, he charges into the prison yard and bops the guard over the head.

00:14:38.931 --> 00:14:43.429
The kazoo stops playing, and with all the snoring still going on,

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:47.538
he grabs his friend and carries him away on his motorcycle!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.604
The snoring gets farther, and farther away, until we don't hear it at all anymore.

00:15:07.787 --> 00:15:10.636
And our hero arrives at last to freedom!

00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:32.628
Now let's hear how this sounds all put together.

00:17:15.765 --> 00:17:19.664
Now all that makes good sense, doesn't it? But it's not the real story at all.

00:17:20.963 --> 00:17:27.057
What this piece really is, is a part of a much longer piece called "Don Quixote" by Richard Strauss;

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:33.547
and Strauss was trying to tell a whole other story in this music.

00:17:34.714 --> 00:17:40.582
Don Quixote is the name of a silly old man, back in the days of knights and armour and horseback -

00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:49.493
a foolish old man who read too many books about knighthood and conquering armies for his beautiful lady,

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:52.925
and who decided he was a marvelous knight himself.

00:17:53.617 --> 00:17:56.629
So off he goes on his skinny, bony old horse,

00:17:57.096 --> 00:17:58.294
to conquer the world.

00:18:02.084 --> 00:18:07.602
He has with him a companion named Sancho Panza, a little fat, jolly 
fellow,

00:18:08.232 --> 00:18:13.547
who is very faithful to his master, but is a sensible type who knows his master is a little coockoo.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.298
And so we hear him laughing at old Don Quixote.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:28.294
Suddenly, the old knight sees a flock of sheep in the field going Baa-baa

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:38.466
And with them is a sheperd playing on his pipe, as all shepherds do.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:51.454
Don Quixote, thinks the sheep are an army specially put there for him to 
conquer,

00:18:51.804 --> 00:18:54.326
so in he rides with his sword flashing.

00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.758
And the sheep run off in all directions, baa-ing wildly.

00:19:02.715 --> 00:19:07.695
He is convinced he has done a truly knightly deed, and he is proud!

00:19:11.742 --> 00:19:17.727
Here we go, with the real story in mind. 

00:20:47.431 --> 00:20:50.902
Now was that music any different from what we played before?

00:20:52.708 --> 00:20:53.937
<v KIDS:> "NO!"

00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.642
<v BERNSTEIN> Is it more exciting or more fun, or better music? (KIDS: NO!)

00:20:58.062 --> 00:21:02.513
Does it have any different meaning? No. It's exactly the same, 

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.521
only the story is different.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:04.540
<i> SKIPPED What's the difference whether this is Superman's secret whistle. or Sancho Panza laughing? It's still the same funny tune. And if this is a shepherd playing his pipe. It can also be a prisoner playing his Kazoo. </i>

00:21:04.614 --> 00:21:09.891
In fact, there are a hundred other stories I could have made up about this piece,

00:21:10.591 --> 00:21:16.918
but the music would still have been just as good or just as bad as it is without any story at all.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.692
Do you see what I mean?

00:21:29.852 --> 00:21:37.114
Now, later in this same "Don Quixote" piece there is a part about another adventure the old fellow has; when he and his friend Sancho Panza 

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.607
have a wild ride through the air.

00:21:49.463 --> 00:21:53.299
In this part there is even a wind-machine in the orchestra

00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:58.327
to give you the feeling of the wind whistling by as they whoosh up and down through the clouds.

00:22:05.307 --> 00:22:08.444
But why couldn't this music be describing the flight of a jet plane?

00:22:09.704 --> 00:22:12.195
Or a satellite moon whistling around in its orbit:

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:17.700
or even another old man snoring?

00:22:21.432 --> 00:22:26.296
Let's make believe it is about a jet plane, and see how the music fits.

00:23:34.771 --> 00:23:36.203
Isn't that exciting music?

00:23:37.074 --> 00:23:39.923
No matter what it's about; it's exciting

00:23:40.506 --> 00:23:43.829
because the music is exciting, and for no other reason.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:43.900
<i> CUT (possible cut from * to *) *Now here is the ending of "Don Quixote" by Strauss; this last part is supposed to tell us the sad story of how the old man dies, dreaming of his beautiful lady, and of his noble adventures. It's one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, slow and singing; and it features a solo by the cello, which will be played by Mr. Varga, But I want you to listen to it as if it didn't tell any story at all, except its own musical story - the way the melodies weave around, and the chords change, and instruments change. I think you'll find it just as wonderful music as if you were following the story - maybe even more wonderful, because then there's no story to get in the way and take your mind off the music itself. Listen to how beautiful it is. </i>

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:43.950
<i> CUT CONT. Isn't that a beauty? And it's especially beautiful when you don's have to think of a story while you're listening to it.*</i>

00:23:44.883 --> 00:23:54.016
Now that's enough talk about music that tells stories. Let's take a big giant step now toward finding out what music means

00:23:55.028 --> 00:23:59.050
by listening to some music that deesn't try to tell a story, but only tried

00:23:59.526 --> 00:24:06.343
to paint a picture, in a general sort of way, or to describe an atmosphere. The look of something,

00:24:06.888 --> 00:24:12.195
or the feel of something - like a sunrise, or a night in the woods, or an old haunted house.

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:19.619
Now we're getting closer to real musical meaning, because we don't have a story to think about while we're listening.

00:24:19.962 --> 00:24:22.903
All we have to think of is a general idea,

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.000
<i>SKIPPED or a picture, and a picture doesn't get in the way of the music as much as a story does, because it hasn't got a lot of details to worry about - like the prisoner and the saxophone, and Superman arriving and leaving and all that.</i>

00:24:23.479 --> 00:24:28.071
So you can concentrate more on the music and enjoy it more.

00:24:29.207 --> 00:24:32.413
For instance, take Beethoven's Sixth Symphony.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:38.125
Here is a great wonderful piece, full of fine tunes and great rhythms and marvelous spirit - happy, driving,

00:24:38.405 --> 00:24:43.542
peaceful, - all kinds of things. But in Beethoven's mind

00:24:44.211 --> 00:24:47.946
this symphony was tied up with the idea of the countryside -

00:24:48.522 --> 00:24:55.153
farmers and brooks and birds and shepherds. So he called it the Pastoral Symphony - as you know, pastoral means

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.114
anything to do with the country.

00:24:58.001 --> 00:25:00.429
At the beginning of the first movement

00:25:00.896 --> 00:25:06.546
he wrote the words:	"Happy feelings at arriving in the country";

00:25:07.153 --> 00:25:08.600
and the music goes like this:

00:25:17.861 --> 00:25:20.522
It sure sounds happy, cheerful, pretty.

00:25:21.129 --> 00:25:24.787
But these feelings could be happy for any other reason, too;

00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:30.779
supposing Beethoven had said "Happy feelings because my uncle left me a million dollars,"

00:25:31.495 --> 00:25:34.997
or "Happy feelings because my bellyache went away" -

00:25:35.978 --> 00:25:40.756
he could still have written this happy music, and it would be just as good, just as happy.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:40.900
<i> SKIPPED So the fact that Beethoven was happy because he left town and walked in the fields doesn't really matter so much, does it? What does matter is that the music is so cheerful and makes us cheerful when we hear it.</i>

00:25:41.394 --> 00:25:47.418
Now, let's try something; let's change the title of this piece, and call it

00:25:48.118 --> 00:25:52.258
"Happy feelings because I was just given a new puppy" 

00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:57.379
- and let let's listen to it with that in mind and see if it sounds any different.

00:26:58.624 --> 00:27:03.636
It's still the same happy music, isn't it, whether it's on account of the countryside or a new puppy.

00:27:04.897 --> 00:27:09.255
Beethoven calls the second movement "Scene by the Brooke."

00:27:10.235 --> 00:27:15.792
And the motion of the music is supposed to imitate, or suggest,

00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:18.702
the motion of the water in the brook.

00:27:26.609 --> 00:27:29.161
But supposing we call it "Asleep in the Hammock,"

00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:35.979
and the motion is now of quiet rocking instead of water - 

00:27:36.321 --> 00:27:38.173
let's see how the music sounds then.

00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:17.772
Doesn't change a thing, does it,

00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:22.401
whether it's water or a hammock? It's the same lovely music.
At the end of this movement, Beethoven 
introduces some bird-calls..... the sound 
of the cuckoo,

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:22.550
<i>SKIPPED to the quail, and the nightingale
Now there you've got me; how can I deny 
that here the music means birds in the 
trees beside that old brook? But I can 
deny it. Sure, they are bird-calls; but 
birds sing, after all, and singing is 
music so again, there we are, dealing 
with music, not with birds. And listen 
to what sweet music it is.</i>

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.550
Now one of the best pieces that paint
pictures is by Mussorgsky - a Russian 
composer --

00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:34.294
-- who wrote a piece called "Pictures at 
an Exhibition." 

00:29:34.787 --> 00:29:40.456
What he did was to take a lot of pictures hanging on the wall in a museum and 

00:29:34.787 --> 00:29:40.456
write music that he thought could describe them - 

00:29:43.956 --> 00:29:48.332
in other words, to try and do with notes what the painter had done with paint. 

00:29:48.678 --> 00:29:51.920
But of course notes can't do what paint can do; 

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:54.954
you can't draw a nose with notes, 

00:29:54.986 --> 00:29:58.778
or a building or a sunset. 

00:29:59.379 --> 00:30:03.335
But you can sort of do it. 

00:30:03.353 --> 00:30:05.760
Anyone. Here's one of those Mussorgsky pictures; --

00:30:06.088 --> 00:30:08.768
--it shows children playing in a park; 

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:12.576
and what Mussorgsky did to make it sound like kids playing 

00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:17.354
was to imitate the way kids talk when they play games 

00:30:17.318 --> 00:30:20.818
- which is almost like singing:

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.935
ALLEE ALLEE ... FREE

00:30:25.795 --> 00:30:29.277 
Or when kids are making fun of each other, 

00:30:29.277 --> 00:30:32.595 
and go (SING-) "Nya nya, nya nya."

00:30:32.704 --> 00:30:37.681 
Listen,

00:31:50.656 --> 00:31:54.831
Then there's another picture Mussorgsky painted with notes; 

00:31:54.795 --> 00:31:58.495
of many little chickens not yet out of their egg-shells.

00:31:58.459 --> 00:32:05.514
Listen to how he imitates their squawking and pecking.

00:33:08.755 --> 00:33:14.844
Then the last one; where he paints a big gate in the city of Kiev -

00:33:15.154 --> 00:33:20.021
- a tremendous stone structure. Now you can see what Mussorgsky had in his mind,

00:33:20.094 --> 00:33:27.240
when you hear these great big strong chords, like pillars holding up those tons of stone.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:25.226
That made you think of a big gate, didn't it?

00:35:25.263 --> 00:35:25.974
<v KIDS> Yes!

00:35:25.263 --> 00:35:25.919
<v BERNSTEIN>

00:35:27.141 --> 00:35:31.405
Yes - but only because I told you beforehand that you were supposed to think of a gate. 

00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:38.480
If I'd told you to think instead of the Mississippi River flowing majestically down the middle of America, 

00:35:38.481 --> 00:35:40.977
you would have seen that in your mind. 

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:49.436
So again - there's the old answer; the picture that goes with music goes with it only because the composer SAYS so;

00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:53.975
but it's not really part of the music. It's extra.

00:35:53.848 --> 00:35:58.825
Now we're going to take another giant step toward finding out the answer to our first question "What does music mean?"

00:36:00.648 --> 00:36:05.497
And this is a really big step; we're getting closer now to the answer!

00:36:05.515 --> 00:36:13.245
We're going to forget about all the pieces of music that tell stories or paint pictures- we've had enough of that 

00:36:13.901 --> 00:36:19.698
- and we're going to listen to music that describes emotions, feelings 

00:36:19.735 --> 00:36:26.954
- like pain, or happiness, or anger, or loneliness, or excitement, or love.

00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:29.470 
I guess most music is like that; 

00:36:29.524 --> 00:36:35.322
and the better it is, the more it will make you feel the emotions that the composer felt when he wrote it. 

00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:45.640
Chaikovsky was a composer who did this - who always tried to have his music mean something emotional. 

00:36:45.968 --> 00:36:49.085
Take this part of his 4th Symphony ---

00:37:00.498 --> 00:37:08.792
I guess the best way to describe it is that it has the feeling of wanting something very badly that you can't have. 

00:37:08.792 --> 00:37:13.423
Did you ever feel you wanted something more than anything else in the world; 

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:18.163
and you said so, and they said no, and you 
said it again - "I want it!" 

00:37:18.144 --> 00:37:24.306
And again they said no, and again you said, louder and more excited, "I want it!" and again, more excited "I want it!"

00:37:24.762 --> 00:37:31.161
until it seemed that something would break inside you and there's nothing left to do but cry? 

00:37:31.163 --> 00:37:33.020
That's like this music

00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:08.770
Then something breaks in your head:

00:38:13.054 --> 00:38:14.403
and you cry,

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:20.164
Listen to the orchestra play it now, and see if you don't feel that emotion.

00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:12.667  
Did you feel it?

00:39:11.044 --> 00:39:12.667  
Now sometimes Chaikovsky uses the same tune to describe two different emotions. 

00:39:22.238 --> 00:39:28.163  
At the beginning of his 5th Symphony he writes this tune,

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:32.082  
for instance which sounds sad and gloomy and depressed.

00:40:09.253 --> 00:40:16.454 
But at the end of the symphony, he changes a couple of notes 

00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:21.522
- what musicians call changing from minor to major 

00:40:21.541 --> 00:40:24.385
- and it all comes out joyful and triumphant, 

00:40:24.585 --> 00:40:30.109
like someone who has just made a touchdown and is the hero of the football game.

00:42:09.555 --> 00:42:24.978
Didn't the music make you feel like the winner? 

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:32.343
How we can really understand what the meaning of music is; it's the way it makes you feel when you hear it. 

00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:39.051
Finally, we've taken the last giant step, and we're there, we can understand music now. 

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:46.015
We don't have to know a lot of stuff about sharps and flats and chords to understand music; 

00:42:46.307 --> 00:42:52.307
if it tell us something - not a story or a picture - but a feeling 

00:42:52.797 --> 00:43:01.712
- if it makes us change inside, and have those different good feelings music can make us have, then we are understanding it. 

00:43:01.639 --> 00:43:08.165
That's all there is to it. Because those feelings aren't like the stories and pictures we talked about before;

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.631
they're not extra; they're not outside the music; they belong to the music;

00:43:13.506 --> 00:43:15.512
they're what music is about.

00:43:16.132 --> 00:43:23.934
And the most wonderful thing of all is that there's no limit to the different kinds of feelings music can make you have. 

00:43:23.825 --> 00:43:30.400
And some of those feelings are so special they can't even be described in words. 

00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:32.812
You see, we can't always name things we feel.

00:43:32.812 --> 00:43:39.284
Sometimes we can; like joy, or sadness,or love, or hate, or peacefulness. 

00:43:39.302 --> 00:43:46.139
But there are other feelings so deep and special that we have no words for them 

00:43:46.175 --> 00:43:49.147
and that's where music is so marvellous;

00:43:49.165 --> 00:43:54.360
it names the feelings for us, only in notes instead of words. 

00:43:54.415 --> 00:43:58.663
It's all in the way music moves - we must never forget that music is movement,

00:43:58.754 --> 00:43:58.772
always going somewhere, shifting and changing, and flowing, 

00:44:02.947 --> 00:44:04.879
from one note to another; 

00:44:05.007 --> 00:44:10.116
and that movement can tell us more about the way we feel than a million words can. 

00:44:10.294 --> 00:44:15.271
Here's a tiny piece by a modern composer named Webern,

00:44:16.528 --> 00:44:21.104
who writes music that's so special in its sounds,

00:44:21.122 --> 00:44:26.026
that some people don't understand it all and just call it crazy modern music.

00:44:26.737 --> 00:44:32.261
But I know that young people can understand the special feelings in this music better than older people, 

00:44:32.863 --> 00:44:39.043
and so I'd like to play it for you.

00:45:39.075 --> 00:46:00.951
Pretty special, isn't it?

00:46:00.951 --> 00:46:03.212
But that's just the wonder of music, 

00:46:03.157 --> 00:46:07.806
that there's no limit to the different kinds of feelings it can make you have.

00:46:08.289 --> 00:46:12.363
For instance.... If I just hold this one 
note for a long time --

00:46:13.858 --> 00:46:16.702
-- it means nothing, all by itself; it's not moving.

00:46:17.504 --> 00:46:22.773
But the minute I play it and then move to another note

00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:27.385
--- right away there's a meaning - a meaning we can't name, 

00:46:27.385 --> 00:46:33.401
something like a stretch, or a pushing, or a pulling, whatever you want - but it's there.

00:46:33.365 --> 00:46:38.979
The meaning is in the way the music moves, and it makes something happen 
inside of you. 

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.646
If I move from that first note to a different one ----

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.423
---- the meaning changes - something else happens inside of you 

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:52.543
- the stretch is bigger, somehow, and stronger.

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:55.564
Now this note ---

00:46:55.697 --> 00:46:57.902
----means one thing with this chord
under it --

00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:05.030
and it makes you feel a certain way----but it means something else with
this other chord under it.

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:06.361
And it makes you have a different feeling.

00:47:20.581 --> 00:47:22.987
These notes --- Do you know what they are?

00:47:26.542 --> 00:47:32.813
Well, they mean something spooky and exciting is going to happen, 

00:47:32.868 --> 00:47:38.501
like "Dragnet"; but the same notes played in a different way --

00:47:44.663 --> 00:47:48.017
<i>SKIPPED What do they mean to you? (KIDS RESPOND)</i>

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:55.474
So you see, the meaning of music is to be found in its melodies, in its 
harmonies, in its rhythms, 

00:47:55.692 --> 00:48:01.891
in its orchestral color, in the way it develops
itself. That's maybe the most important 
part - how music develops and grows 
from the beginning of a piece to its 
end - 

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.409
and that's what we're going to talk about at another concert in the 
near future.

00:48:05.427 --> 00:48:12.811
But right now, all you have to know is that music has its own meanings, right there for you to feel inside the music; 

00:48:12.738 --> 00:48:16.493
and you don't need any stories or pictures 
to tell you what it means. 

00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:22.600
If you like music at all, you'll find out the meanings 
for yourselves, just by listening; 

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:22.700
<i>SKIPPED And most people do like music, so why shouldn't you?</i>

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:27.486
So now, I want you all to listen to one short piece with no explanation from anybody. 

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:27.600
<i>SKIPPED I think by now you're ready for it - just to listen, without any hints.</i>

00:48:27.741 --> 00:48:32.600
I'm not going to tell you anything about it, except its name and 
who wrote it, 

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:37.700
<i>SKIPPED but no stories and no pictures.</i>

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.880
And you just all sit back and relax,and enjoy it, listen to the notes, 

00:48:39.135 --> 00:48:46.628
feel them move around, jumping, hopping, bumping, flashing, sliding, 

00:48:46.573 --> 00:48:52.534
and just enjoy THAT without a whole lot of fuss about stories and pictures.

00:48:52.479 --> 00:48:57.256
The piece we're going to play is called "La Valse", and it was written by Ravel. 

00:48:57.383 --> 00:49:08.467
I think you'll like it because it's fun to listen to - not because it's about anything. It's just good, exciting music.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:55.400
