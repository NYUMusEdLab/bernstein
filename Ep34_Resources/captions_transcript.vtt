00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.019  
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)> From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center,

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.000  
home of the world's greatest musical events,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.099  
another program in the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.989  
award-winning series: the New York

00:00:31.989  --> 00:00:34.360  
Philharmonic Young People's Concerts,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.390  
under the musical direction of 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390  
Leonard Bernstein.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.769  
<v BERNSTEIN> That beautiful melody is from the

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.500  
Leningrad Symphony by Dmitri

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.670  
Shostakovich, and that's a typical

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.510  
Shostakovich sound: broad, noble, proud, songful,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.510 
rich with feeling. During the coming

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.080  
year, 1966, this extraordinary Russian

00:02:35.080  --> 00:02:38.080  
composer is going to be 60 years old, and

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.200  
we are therefore dedicating this program

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.200
to him and to his lifelong devotion to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.950 
his art. May it long continue. But since

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.150  
this is a birthday party, I'd like to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.090  
take a minute or two before we play 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.269  
his music to make a sort of after-dinner

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269 
speech in his honor. I particularly want

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.129
to do this because in these days of

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.160 
musical experimentation, with new fads

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.019 
chasing each other in and out of the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.170  
concert halls, a composer like

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.400  
Shostakovich can be easily put down.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.310 
After all, he's basically a traditional

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.829
Russian composer -- a true son of

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.889 
Tchaikovsky! And no matter how modern he

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.290
ever gets, he never loses that tradition;

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.980 
so the music is always, in some way,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.569  
old-fashioned -- or, at least, what critics

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.319  
and musical intellectuals like to call

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.730  
old-fashioned. But they're forgetting one

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.910  
most important thing: he's a genius -- a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.400  
real, authentic genius. And there aren't too

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.400
many of those around anymore. So that's

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.169 
why I want to make this personal

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:44.919 
birthday toast to him. When the New

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.099 
York Philharmonic and I visited Russia,

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.950 
back in 1959, I had the pleasure and

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.530  
privilege of meeting Shostakovich, and I

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
had an impression of a very reserved man,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.319
speaking very little, a bit nervous and

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.590  
very shy. I suspect that that's the true

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.780
nature of the man, but you'd never know

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.569  
it from hearing his music. As a composer he

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.389 
has a great deal to say -- serious or light,

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.819
whatever it happens to be -- and he says

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.250  
it with enormous confidence, ease, and

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.799
boldness. I suppose that's one of the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.350  
most fascinating things about artists --

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.110 
how different they can be as people from

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.470 
the art they create. The most sure-handed

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.230 
painter may be very insecure in his

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.230 
daily life; the greatest writer and they

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.270 
have trouble spelling the simplest words;

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.330 
and the most intelligent physicist may

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.520  
be incapable of adding up an ordinary

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.650
grocery bill. Shostakovich

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.960 
is a bit like that. Out of this

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.040 
shy man, hidden behind his eyeglasses, has

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.210 
come some of the most powerful, brash,

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.760  
un-shy music ever written. His famous

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.860 
Seventh Symphony, known as the "Leningrad"

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.380
Symphony -- which was written in Leningrad

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.340 
in 1941 while the city was more often

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.100
than not in flames from the Nazi

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.900 
bombings -- that Seventh Symphony lasts 75

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.360 
minutes, requires an extra brass band, and

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.970
makes the walls fall down. Nothing shy

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.120
about that. His latest symphony, which is

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.200  
number 13, lasts an hour and includes a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.870
chorus which sings yet to Yevtushenkoâ€™s

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.170 
famous poem against anti-Semitism. So, 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.090 
you see, Shostakovich has a lot to say

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.880 
musically, and very often what he says is

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.780 
noble, original, and deeply moving. But

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.000  
this is a birthday party, and birthday

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280 
parties should be gay and amusing, not

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.940  
necessarily noble and moving. Besides, you

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.530  
should know that Shostakovich is also

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.480 
world famous for his marvellous sense of

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.050
humor.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.760 
He's written some of the most downright

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.480  
funny music there is to be heard, and

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.220 
therefore, I think it's especially proper

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.310
for us to celebrate his birthday in an

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.490  
atmosphere of fun. So, in just a moment,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.070 
instead of a long, serious work, we're

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.410
going to play you one of his gayest and

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.920 
most amusing works: his Ninth Symphony.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.060  
Although this Symphony has five

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.550  
movements, it's a very short work, so we

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.530  
can play you all of it, and I think

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.000 
you're going to enjoy it a lot.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.940 
This 9th Symphony by Shostakovich is

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940 
rather like a witty comedy in the theater,

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.780  
where you're treated to one joke after another --

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.020  
puns,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.810 
wisecracks, punchlines, surprises,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.080
twisteroos -- but somehow all adding up to

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.020
a work of art. Now, almost every symphony

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.790 
has some kind of joke in it: even the

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.770 
most serious symphony by Beethoven or

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.350  
Mahler has at least one movement (usually

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.780
called the Scherzo) which is humorous --

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.290 
maybe not out-and-out comical, but satirical,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.200 
or bitter, or mocking, or something. But

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.690 
this whole symphony by Shostakovich is

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.700
all humorous, every minute and every

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.540 
movement. It's all one big series of jokes.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.090 
The first and foremost joke is the very

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.610 
fact that it is his ninth symphony. You

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.620
may well ask what's so funny about that;

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.310
well, I'll tell you. That number nine is a

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.040
magic number with composers. Ever since

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.410
Beethoven, it's come to mean the crowning

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.320 
final output of a symphonic composer.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.620
Beethoven's Ninth, as you must know, is the

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.510  
huge symphonic monument of his whole

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.810
lifetime -- his last symphony -- and since then,

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.060  
it's become almost a tradition for a

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.370 
composer to crown his life with his

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.620 
ninth symphony -- if he can make it, of

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.530 
course. Mahler and Bruckner did make it;

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.080 
they both wrote gigantic ninth symphonies

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.280
of farewell. Brahms and Schumann never

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.310  
got beyond number four, Mendelssohn did

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.760  
reach 5, and Tchaikovsky reached 6, but if

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.280 
you can reach number 9, it had better be

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.010  
a whopper, worthy of that magic number.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.490
But not Shostakovich. You see, he had just

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.710 
written two whoppers, number seven and

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.470  
number eight -- both very long, very serious,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.229
very patriotic symphonies, and both

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.630
having grown out of his wartime emotions.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.800 
But now, it was 1945, the war was over, and

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.289
it was time for some comic relief from

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.650 
those two gigantic symphonies 7 and 8. So

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.729
out came number 9 -- a little number 9, and

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:28.330
that in itself is a twisteroo.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.220 
But the real jokes begin with the music

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.070 
itself. Listen to the opening theme, for

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.400 
instance:

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.730 
Now that doesn't sound like modern music,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.340 
does it? It's more like Haydn from two

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.680 
centuries ago. In fact, the whole first

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.510
movement is written like an old-time

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.540 
classical symphony, as if by Haydn, with

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.300  
all the rules strictly observed. Now, that

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.010 
also doesn't sound very funny at first,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.200 
does it? But it turns out to be as soon

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.840
as you realize that it's not by Haydn but

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.480 
by a modern composer named Shostakovich,

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.030  
and that this 18th century classical

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.600  
form is really just a spoof -- a take-off of

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.630  
the old eighteenth-century form. And the

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.820 
more strictly it imitates Haydn, the

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.740  
funnier it is, as you begin to recognize

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.070   
your old pals Exposition, Development, and

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.880  
Recapitulation -- remember those three hard

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.220 
words, three parts of the sonata form,

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.070 
that we discussed in a program last year?

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.920
And he goes even further by dutifully

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.870  
repeating the exposition just as he's

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.970  
supposed to, by putting the second theme

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.830 
in the dominant key, just as the old

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.990  
rules dictated, and having the

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.480 
recapitulation of it in the tonic key -- all

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.570 
those formulas from the distant past dug

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.720  
up again and made fun of. What makes it

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.120 
even funnier is that his gay little

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.180 
Haydn-ish tunes are treated to a modern

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.580 
facelifting, so that they're constantly

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.250 
surprising you into double takes with

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:09.380 
their 20th century sound. For instance,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.600  
that merry opening theme in E-flat

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.300 
major we just heard bounces along just

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.630 
like Haydn -- until it suddenly stumbles

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.530 
on a loud wrong note:

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.590  
Now that wrong note 

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.860
wouldn't sound so

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.380
wrong if it didn't have such a strong

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.150   
accent on it, to say nothing of a trill --

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.250  
-- which makes the accent even stronger. In

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.830  
other words, Shostakovich is calling your

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.930 
special attention to this wrong note,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.570 
like a clown who slips on a banana peel

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.990 
and laughs at himself before you do. But

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.880 
it's not only those mischievous wrong-

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.010  
note tunes of Shostakovich that make his

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.920  
humor; it's also his way of adding or

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.870 
skipping a beat here and there where you

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.270 
least expect it, as in this little theme

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:07.280  
which follows the one we just heard.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.110 
Now, did you hear that extra beat? It's

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.150 
especially easy to hear in this tune,

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.430   
which goes in what is called a sequence --

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.430   
that is, the same phrase is repeated at a

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.770  
higher pitch. So once you hear the first

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:23.750   
phrase -- [OBOE] -- then you expect the second one

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:27.760 
to be identical, only higher, like this: [OBOE]

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.740 
But that's not what you get -- almost, but

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.560 
not quite. What you do get is a second

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.000  
phrase that repeats the first at a

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.400 
higher pitch, alright, but with one extra

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.100 
beat added -- just enough to knock you off

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.300  
balance, like that

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.060
tipsy clown. 

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.060 
Do you hear it now? I thought you

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.970   
would. Of course, it's not the sort of

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.440  
joke that will make you shriek with

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.350  
laughter -- I mea, no musical joke is -- but

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.210  
it's just enough of a twist to make you

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.430  
smile inside, and that's what a good

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.220   
musical joke should do. Now, this movement

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.170   
is full of twists like that: melodic

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.420  
surprises, and rhythmic surprises, and

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.140
especially harmonic surprises -- that is,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.640 
moments when you expect the harmony to

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.380   
go one way and it goes somewhere else

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.080 
completely unexpectedly, like this spot a

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.030 
little later on in the movement, where

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.580
the opening theme is repeated in the

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.100 
original key of E-flat major and must

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.320  
now switch to another key, in which the

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.510 
second theme is going to appear, namely

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.480  
the dominant, or B-flat major. But

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.430  
Shostakovich switches his key

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.830  
to the furthest harmonic point away from

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.110  
B-flat major, so that when B-flat

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.630   
finally does appear, it's a shocker, right

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.640 
out of the blue. Now, look how he does it:

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.190  
here's the first theme, with its harmonic switch. 

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.470
Now that's a mile away from where

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.200  
we're headed -- B-flat. But without so much

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.390
as a blink of the eye, Shostakovich

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.520  
wrenches us into the required key of

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.190
B-flat, like this.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.770 
You see, there was no

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.350  
preparation at all for this new key, or

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.640
rather, there was a misleading

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.070  
preparation, as if for some totally

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.060  
foreign key, and then bam -- B-flat major.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.649  
Now, listen to the whole section and see

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:23.959 
how the harmony jerks you from key to

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:25.430 
key.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.790 
It's like a ride on some mad Coney

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.430  
Island machine, where you're whipped and

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.950
flung in fifty different directions, always when you

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.000  
least expect it.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.210  
But anyway, shaken up as we are, we have

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.550  
reached the dominant key of D-flat and

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.740  
we are now ready for the appearance of

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.810 
the second theme. Here comes another

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.510 
twist: you may remember from our program

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.910 
on sonata form that the second theme of

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.220
a symphonic movement should provide a

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.470 
contrast with the first theme, not only

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.280 
in key, but also in feeling -- that is, if the

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.770 
first theme is strong and manly, the

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.840
second theme is likely to be sweet and

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.660 
feminine, or vice-versa. Anyway, in this

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.250 
case, the first theme, as you heard, was

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.580  
playful and bouncy, and so we're led to

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.160 
expect a second theme that will contrast

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.010  
by being sweet and smooth. And what do we

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.800 
get? Anything but, because out comes a

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.530 
jaunty little marching tune whistled by

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.380  
the tiny, tinny piccolo.

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:48.839 
And so on. So we've got another surprise.

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:51.720  
You see, most musical jokes are surprises,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.269  
just as most other jokes are: you expect

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.619  
one thing and you get another, and

00:14:55.619 --> 00:14:57.419 
somehow that tickles your funny bone.

00:14:57.419 --> 00:15:00.269  
Nobody knows why. And this surprising,

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:03.869 
silly second theme sounds even sillier

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.660  
when it comes back in the recapitulation,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.369  
because this time it's played not even

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:11.429 
by the piccolo, but by one single solo

00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:14.279 
violin who's forcing out that squeaky

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.079 
little tune over the accompaniment of a

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.390 
whole brass section:

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.050  
It's like Mickey Mouse leading a football

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:35.869  
cheer! 

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.910
It's that high, puny voice competing

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.000  
with a whole brass band. And speaking

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.850 
of the brass band, my favorite joke of the

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.340  
whole movement is made by that hefty

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.640  
trombone back there who introduces this

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.530   
tune each time it comes with those

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.000 
pompous two notes. 

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.910 
Now, as you'll see when

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.280 
we play the whole movement, all through

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.470 
this section of the recapitulation, which

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.540 
leads up to the squeaky second theme,

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.570
that trombone keeps plowing in with his

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.120  
two notes, always in the wrong places, as

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.640 
though he's skipped 50 bars of music by

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.970   
mistake and is coming too soon.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.010  
Poor man, he's absolutely lost! But he

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.280 
doesn't give up: he keeps trying, like

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.710  
Pluto in those same cartoons.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.550  
Thank goodness, he's made it at last! Now

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.860   
he's in the right place, and the cartoon

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.800 
ends in a burst of pride and glory. Now

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.690  
naturally, I can't tell you all the jokes

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.060  
in advance; I've got to leave some of you

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.490  
to discover for yourselves, which I hope

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.650  
you will so that you get the maximum

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.260 
enjoyment out of this delightful first

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.140 
movement of the Ninth Symphony by Dmitri

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.210 
Shostakovich.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.760  
The second movement of this Ninth

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.520 
Symphony by Shostakovich doesn't seem to

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.010  
be a joke at all, at first: it's a quiet,

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.610  
sweet, little waltz -- actually rather sad.

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.250  
There's no horseplay here, as there was with

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.990  
the trombone in the first movement -- in

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.640  
fact, the trumpets and trombones don't

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.770
play at all in this piece, and neither

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.260 
does the percussion. It's all on a much

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.570 
smaller scale, almost like chamber music,

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.390  
with haunting, long melodies played by

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.790 
solo woodwind instruments. It opens with

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.300
this clarinet solo:

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.050  
And so it goes on, wending its melancholy

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.050 
way. And later, that same long line is

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.540 
repeated by the solo flute, and at the

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.090  
very end by our old friend the piccolo,

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.700 
who as you'll see has changed from his

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.680  
perky personality of the first movement

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.490 
into this gently wistful one. In

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.590  
between these different woodwind solos,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.500  
the strings play strange, yearning waves

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.210 
of melody:

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.210
It's rather brooding, isn't it?

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.290 
[WITH ACCENT] Very Russian! Now, certainly none of that

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.930  
material sounds particularly humorous or

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.420 
jokey. Well, then, where does the humor

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.070 
come in? Didn't I say that this whole

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.100 
symphony was a comedy? All right, let me

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.950 
explain. The humor of this movement is

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.960  
that it just doesn't belong in a

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.060 
symphony at all -- especially a ninth

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.150   
symphony. With its reduced chamber-size

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.370  
orchestra and its sad little waltz

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.380  
themes, it's more like what used to be

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.380
called "salon music" -- that is, music not so

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.350  
much for the concert hall as for hotel

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.900 
lobbies and old-fashioned restaurants,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.540  
and maybe a private, elegant tea party.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.700  
It's a piece that might have been called,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.200 
in times gone by,

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.260 
"Valse MÃ©lancolique," or something like that --

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.300
which just doesn't mean a melancholy

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.630  
waltz, but suggests a whole era of grand,

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.300 
faded elegance. And the fact that 

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.980 
Shostakovich puts this of all things

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.440  
into his Ninth Symphony shows a very

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.870 
subtle brand of humor -- nothing to make

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.790 
you fall on the floor with laughter, but

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.910  
to fill you with a light, sweet,

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.350   
unexpected pleasure. Again, it's the

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.300
unexpected quality of it that makes you

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.170 
smile, even a melancholy smile. So here is

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.860  
the very unsymphonic second movement of this most

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.060  
unusual symphony.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.070  
Pretty, charming, sweet music -- and anything

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.830
but symphonic, I think you'll agree. But

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.490 
now, enough of melancholy: from here on in,

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.100   
the jokes fly, thick and fast. The three

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.170 
little movements which conclude this

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.630 
symphony are all joined together, played

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.930 
continuously, like one big stream of fun.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.510  
First comes the scherzo, that

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.429  
traditionally humorous movement that

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.010  
occurs in almost every symphony. In fact,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.909 
the word "scherzo" means "joke" in Italian,

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.100  
and Shostakovich's Scherzo is no

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.100  
exception. It's fast, light-hearted, and brilliant,

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.679 
full of rollicking rhythms, delicious

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.290  
wrong notes, and startling twists of

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.600 
harmony. And right in the middle of this

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.510  
playful movement, there is suddenly a

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.450  
stamping Spanish rhythm, over which a

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.970
solo trumpet blares out a startling

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:41.600  
Spanish tune, like bullfight music:

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.490  
Now, what in the world is a Spanish 

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.700
bullfighter doing in this symphony? Well,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.349 
as I said, it's full of surprises;

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.869 
anything can happen. It's as though

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:21.730 
suddenly at a party, somebody grabbed the

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.619  
Spanish shawl off the piano and wrapped

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:25.930
himself in it and gave out with a wild

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.339
gypsy dance. It's insane! But the best joke of

00:35:30.339 --> 00:35:32.740 
the Scherzo is still to come, which is

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.990 
that it simply dies. Imagine, this

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.109  
rollicking peace suddenly winds down, like

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:40.630 
an old phonograph, and comes to an

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.700
embarrassed stop on the most unlikely

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.520  
note, as if it didn't know quite what to

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.160 
do or where to go. And where it does go

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.530  
is the most unexpected place of all --

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.530 
straight into the fourth movement,

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.550 
which is a total surprise: it's only two

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.070 
pages long. You can't really even call it

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.980 
a movement. But in those two pages, we

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.190
find the main joke of the whole symphony,

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.839  
because the music suddenly becomes slow

00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:07.089 
and pompous and solemn. Imagine, in the

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:09.460  
middle of this happy little symphony, the

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.670   
trombones, with all their might, thunder out

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.130  
a majestic fanfare, as if to introduce

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.660 
some great tragic utterance.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.990
Good heavens, what a change! Is this joke-

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.660
symphony really going to pieces? What are

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.549 
we doing with great utterances? It's gone

00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:46.069   
insane! But let's see what this tragic

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:48.740 
statement turns out to be. It turns out to

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.470  
be a bassoon solo in a free reciting

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.210  
style, very mournful and very tragic. 

00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:08.210 
Now that doesn't seem to belong in this

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.609 
symphony any more than that Spanish

00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:13.730 
fandango we heard before! Why just that

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.619 
bassoon solo? I'll tell you: it's a

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:18.140  
private musical joke, because what 

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.140
Shostakovich is doing is imitating a similar

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.990
passage in Beethoven's Ninth Symphony,

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.970  
the part that introduces the famous "Ode

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.519 
to Joy," which I'm sure you all know:

00:37:28.519 --> 00:37:30.410 
[SINGS] "Freude, schÃ¶ner GÃ¶tterfunken,

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.019   
Tochter aus Elysium" -- you know that.

00:37:34.019 --> 00:37:36.130 
...Yes, I see you do. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:39.130 
Well, just before that place in the Ninth

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.690 
Symphony, Beethoven has put this

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.000  
recitation by the cellos and basses:

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.049  
And now here, Shostakovich -- and his Ninth

00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:07.349 
Symphony -- has his mournful bassoon doing

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:09.940
much the same thing, even in the same key --

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:14.940
-- as if to say, "this is going to be a real

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.519  
Ninth Symphony, tragic and monumental and

00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:20.700  
everything! Just like Beethoven!" So, he has

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.250  
his trombones repeat the pompous fanfare,

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.890  
and again he has the bassoon wail out

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.769  
that cadenza, only even more mournful now

00:38:28.769 --> 00:38:33.180  
and more Russian, more emotional. And that's

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.099  
the end of the whole fourth movement,

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:38.339   
because, super-surprise of all, that same

00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:40.890   
doleful bassoon, without so much as

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.940  
drawing breath from his last note, slyly sneaks

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.920  
into a kittenish little dance tune.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.690  
And the tune gradually gathers momentum, as

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.950 
little by little the whole orchestra

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.350  
picks it up, until soon we're galloping

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.690 
away into the fifth and final movement,

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.480 
which is a brilliant breathless Rondo.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.230  
And so it turns out that, after all, that

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.910
pompous little fourth movement was just

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.270   
a decoy to lure us into expecting a real

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.090  
Ninth Symphony -- a great Beethoven-ish

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.520 
one -- and then only to find that it's

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.470  
still that same, darling little

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.900  
Shostakovich Ninth that we started with.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.480  
It's like sitting down to a big, serious

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.180  
banquet and being served hotdogs and

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.120 
potato chips. Some people might not

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.820 
think that very funny, either, but I am

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.680  
sorry for them, because they won't get

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.840   
the jokes in this symphony. So you have

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.340  
to have as much of a sense of humor to

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.830  
appreciate this music as Shostakovich

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.110  
had to have in order to write it. And I

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.240
very much hope that you do, so that you

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.010   
can now enjoy these concluding three

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.950 
movements: that Spanish-type scherzo, and

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.470
then the pompous trombone and bassoon

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.220 
bit, and the exciting final joyride. Happy

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.130 
listening, and happy birthday, Dmitri

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.000 
Shostakovich!

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.960
