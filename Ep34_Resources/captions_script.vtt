00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.019  
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)> From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center, 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.000  
home of the world’s greatest musical events,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.099  
another program in the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.989 
award-winning series -- THE NEW YORK 

00:00:31.989  --> 00:00:34.360
PHILHARMONIC YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCERTS 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.390 
under the musical direction of 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.390  
Leonard Bernstein -- 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.490 
SKIPPED is brought to you by The Bell System, providing you and your family with the best in dependable, low cost telephone service.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.799  
And here is Mr. Bernstein.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.769 
<v BERNSTEIN> That is the sound of 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:27.510
Dmitri Shostakovich: brilliant, powerful, noble, proud, declamatory, 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.510 
rich with feeling. During this coming 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.080 
year of 1966, this extraordinary Russian 

00:02:35.080  --> 00:02:38.080 
composer will be 60 years old; and 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.200  
we are dedicating this program 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.200
to him and to his lifelong devotion to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.950 
his art. May it long continue. Since 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.150  
this is a birthday party, I'd like to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.090  
take a minute or two before we play 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.269  
his music to make a sort of after-dinner 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.269 
speech in his honor. I particularly want 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.129
to do this because, in these days of 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.160 
musical experimentation, with new fads 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.019 
chasing each other in and out of 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.170
concert-halls, a composer like 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.400  
Shostakovich can be easily put down.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.310 
After all, he is basically a traditional 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.829
Russian composer -- a true son of 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.889 
Chaikovsky! and no matter how "modern" he 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.290
gets, he never loses that tradition; 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.980 
so the music is always, in some way, 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.569 
old-fashioned -- at least, what critics 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.319  
and musical intellectuals like to call 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.730 
old-fashioned. But they’re forgetting one 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.910  
most important thing: he’s a genius -- a 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.400 
real, authentic genius. And there aren’t too 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.400
many of those around any more. That’s 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.169 
why I want to make this 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.070
toast to him.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.170
SKIPPED Shostakovich is a man of tremendous creativity. He has written symphonies -- 13 of them -- concertos, operas, chamber music, piano music, songs -- even a musical comedy. He is also a man of many moods, ranging from the most serious and gigantic symphonies to pieces so flip and trivial you can't believe they’re by the same composer. But what binds them all together is their Russian-ness.Shostakovich's devotion has not been only to his art, but also to his country, even to the principles of the Revolution in which he grew up. He is an extremely patriotic man, but he is also an individual, original artist; and that combination has sometimes gotten him into hot water with the people who guide that very revolution to which he is so dedicated. But always Shostakovich has bounced back into favor, either by apologizing, or by slightly changing his style, or perhaps really because the Russians know that he is their greatest composer, and they can’t afford to do without him. They simply have to forgive him — and so they do, which is all to their credit.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.919 
When the New 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.099
York Philharmonic and I visited Russia, 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.950 
back in 1959, we twice had the pleasure and 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.429
privilege of playing Shostakovich’s music in his presence.

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:53.530
SKIPPED On both occasions he was very kind and generous with his compliments, came to the stage and embraced me, Russian style, and in general behaved like anybody's favorite uncle or brother-in-law.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.500 
But on other occasions I had an impression of a very reserved man, 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.319
speaking almost not at all, a bit nervous, and 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.590  
very shy. I suspect that that is the true 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.780
nature of the man; but you'd never know 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.569  
it from hearing his music. As a composer he 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.389
has a great deal to say, serious 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:12.819
or light, and he says 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.250  
it with enormous confidence, ease, and 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.799
boldness. I suppose that's one of the 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.350  
most fascinating things about vrtists -- 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.110 
how different they can be, as people, from 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.470 
the art they create. The most sure-handed 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.230 
painter may be very insecure in his 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.230 
daily life; the greatest writer may 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.270
have trouble spelling the simplest words; 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.330 
the most intelligent physicist may 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.520 
be incapable of adding up a 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.650
grocery bill. Shostakovich 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.960 
is a bit like that. Out of this 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.040
shy man, hidden behind his eyeglasses, has 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.210 
come some of the most potent, brash, 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.760  
un-shy music ever written. His famous 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.860 
7th Symphony, known as the "Leningrad 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.380
Symphony" -- which was written in Leningrad 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.340 
while the city was more often 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.100
than not in flames from the German 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.900 
bombings -- that 7th Symphony lasts 75 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.360
minutes, requires an extra brass band, and 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.970
makes the walls fall down. Nothing shy 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.120
about that. His latest symphony, 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.200  
number 13, lasts an hour, and includes a 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.870
male chorus which sings Yevtushenko’s 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.170 
famous poem against anti-semitism. Yes, 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.090 
Shostakovich has a lot to say, 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.880
musically, and very often what he says is 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.780 
noble, original, and deeply moving. But 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.000  
this is a birthday party for Shostakovich, and birthday 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280 
parties should be gay and amusing, not 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.940 
necessarily noble and moving. Besides,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:46.040 
SKIPPED you should know that apart from his patriotism, nobility, seriousness, and all the rest,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.530
Shostakovich is also 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.480 
world-famous for his marvelous sense of 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.050
humor. 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.760 
He has written some of the most downright 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.480
funny music there is to be heard. So 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.220 
I think it's especially proper 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.310
for us to celebrate his birthday in an 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.490  
atmosphere of fun. 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.070 
Instead of a long serious work, we’re 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.410
going to play you one of his gayest and 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.920 
most amusing works -- his 9th Symphony. 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.550  
It’s a short work, so we 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.530  
can play you all of it, and I think 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.000 
you’re going to enjoy it a lot.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.940 
The 9th Symphony by Shostakovich is 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.940 
like a witty comedy in the theatre, 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.780  
where you are treated to one joke after another -- 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.020 
puns, 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.810 
wise-cracks, sight-gags, punch-lines, surprises, 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.080
twisteroos -- but somehow all adding up to 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.020
a work of art. Now almost every symphony 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.790 
has some kind of joke in it: even the 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.770 
most serious symphony by Beethoven or 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.350 
Mahler has at least one movement (usually 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.780
called the scherzo) which is humorous -- 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.290 
maybe not out-and-out comical, but humorous in some way: 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.200 
either bitterly humorous, or merrily humorous, or mockingly humorous. But 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.690 
this whole symphony by Shostakovich is 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.700
all humorous, every minute and every 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.540 
movement. It is all one big series of jokes.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.090 
The first and foremost joke is the very 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.610 
fact that it is his Ninth Symphony. You 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.620
may well ask what’s so funny about that; 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.310
well, I’ll tell you. That number nine is a 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.040
magic number with composers; ever since 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.410
Beethoven it has come to mean the crowning 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.320 
final achievement of a symphonic composer. 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.620
Beethoven’s Ninth, as you must know, is the 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.510
huge symphonic monument of his whole 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.809
lifetime -- his last symphony. And since then, 

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.810 
SKIPPPED
there have been many other great and final Ninth Symphonies, all of them gigantic farewells -- Schubert’s 9th, Mahler’s 9th, Bruckner’s 9th -- and so 

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.060 
it’s become almost a tradition for a 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.370 
composer to end his life with his 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.620
9th symphony -- if he can make it, of 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:46.280
course. Brahms and Schumann never 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.310  
got beyond number 4. Mendelssohn reached 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:52.760
5, and Chaikovsky 6. But if 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.280 
you can reach number 9, it had better be 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.010 
a whopper, worthy of its magic number.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:01.490
Not Shostakovich, though. You see, he had just 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.710 
written two whoppers, numbers 7 and 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.470  
8 -- both very long, very serious, 

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:09.229
very patriotic, and both 

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:11.630
having grown out of his wartime emotions.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.800 
But now it was 1945, the war was over, and 

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.289
it was time for a little relief from 

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.650 
those two gigantic symphonies 7 and 8. So 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.729
out came No. 9 -- a little number 9; and 

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:28.330
that in itself is a twisteroo.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.220 
But the real jokes begin with the music 

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:54.680
itself. 

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.510
The first movement, for instance, is written like an old-time 

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.540 
classical symphony, as if by Haydn, with 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.300  
all the rules strictly observed. That 

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.010 
also doesn’t sound very funny at first, 

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.200 
but it turns out to be as soon 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.840
as you realize that it's not by Haydn, but 

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.480 
by a modern composer named Shostakovich; 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.030 
and that this 18th century classical 

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.600  
form is really just a spoof -- a take-off of 

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.630  
the old form. And the 

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.820 
more strictly it imitates Haydn, the 

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.740  
funnier it is, as you begin to recognize 

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.070   
your old pals -- Exposition, Development, and 

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.880 
Recapitulation -- remember those 

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.220 
3 parts of the sonata form?

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.070 
And he goes even further by dutifully 

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.920
repeating the exposition, by putting the 2nd theme 

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.970  
in the dominant key, just as the old 

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.990 
rules dictated, and having the 

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.480 
recapitulation of it in the tonic key -- all 

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.570 
those formulas from the distant past, dug 

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.720
up again, and burlesqued. What makes it 

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.120 
even funnier is that his gay little 

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:02.180 
Haydn-ish tunes are treated to a modern 

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.580 
face-lifting, so that they’re constantly 

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.380 
surprising you into double-takes. For instance, 

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.600  
the very opening theme is a merry, 

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.300 
bouncing tune in E-flat major, just 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.630 
like Haydn -- until it suddenly stumbles 

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.530 
on a loud wrong note.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.860  
Now that wrong note (SING) wouldn't sound so 

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.380
wrong if it didn't have such a strong 

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.150 
accent on it, to say nothing of a trill --

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.250  
-- which makes the accent even stronger. In 

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:39.830
other words, Shostakovich is calling your 

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.930 
special attention to this wrong note, 

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.570 
like a clown who slips on a banana peel, 

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.990 
and laughs at himself before you do. But 

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.880 
it's not only these mischievous wrong-

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.010  
note tunes of Shostakovich that make his 

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.920 
humor; it’s also his way of adding or 

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.870 
skipping a beat here and there, where you 

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.270 
least expect it — as in this little theme, 

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.280  
which follows the one we just heard.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.110 
Did you hear that extra beat? It’s 

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.150 
especially obvious in this tune, 

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.430 
which goes in what is called a sequence -- 

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.430  
that is, the same phrase repeated at a 

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:18.770 
higher pitch. So once you hear the first 

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:19.750  
phrase,--

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.750  
-- you expect the 2nd one 

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.150 
to be identical, only higher:

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.740 
But that’s not what you get -- almost, but 

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.560 
not quite. What you do get is a second 

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.000
phrase that repeats the first at a 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.400 
higher pitch all right, but with one extra 

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.100 
beat added -- just enough to knock you off 

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.300  
balance -- like that 

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.060
tipsy clown.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.060 
Do you hear it now? I’m sure you do. 

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.970  
Of course it’s not the sort of 

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.440 
joke that will make you shriek with 

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.350  
laughter -- no musical joke is; but 

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.210  
it’s just enough of a twist to make you 

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.430  
smile inside — and that’s what a good 

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:04.220  
musical joke should do. This movement 

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.170  
is full of twists like that: melodic 

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.420  
surprises, rhythmic surprises, and 

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:12.140
especially harmonic surprises -- that is, 

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.640 
moments when you expect the harmony to 

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:15.380  
go one way, and it goes somewhere else, 

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.080 
completely unexpectedly. Like this spot a 

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.030 
little later on, where 

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:22.580
the opening theme is repeated, very loud, in the 

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.100 
original key of E-flat major, and must 

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.320  
now switch to another key, in which the 

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.510 
second theme is going to appear -- namely 

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.480  
the dominant, B-flat major. But 

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.430  
Shostakovich switches his key 

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.830  
to the furthest harmonic point away from 

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.110 
B-flat major, so that when B-flat 

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.630 
finally does appear it's a shocker, right 

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.640
out of the blue. Look how he does it: 

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.190  
here is the first theme, with its harmonic switch.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.470
That's a mile away from where 

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.200  
we're headed: but without so much 

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.390
as a blink of the eye, Shostakovich 

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.520  
wrenches us into the required new key of 

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.190 
B-flat.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:09.770 
You see? No 

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:12.350
preparation at all for this new key -- or 

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:13.640
rather a misleading 

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.070  
preparation, as if for a totally 

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.060  
foreign key, and then -- bang! B-flat major. 

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:21.649  
Listen to the whole section now, and see 

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:23.959 
how the harmony jerks you from key to 

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:25.430 
key:

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.790 
See, it's like a ride on some mad Coney 

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.430  
Island machine -- The Whip, I think they call it -- where you're whipped and 

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:42.950
flung in fifty directions, always when you 

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.000  
least expect it. 

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.210  
But anyway, shaken up as we are, we have 

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.550  
reached the dominant key of B-flat, and 

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:51.740  
are now ready for the appearance of 

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:56.510 
the 2nd theme. Now, you may remember from our program 

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.910 
on Sonata Form that the 2nd theme of 

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.220
a symphonic movement should provide a 

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.470 
contrast with the first theme — not only 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.280 
in key, but also in feeling; that is, if the 

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.770 
first theme is strong and manly, the 

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.840
2nd theme is likely to be sweet and 

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.660 
feminine. Or vice versa. Anyway, in this 

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.250 
case the first theme was 

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.580 
playful and bouncy; so we are led to 

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:22.160 
expect a 2nd theme that will contrast 

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.010  
by being sweet and smooth. And what do we 

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.800 
get? Anything but. Instead, out comes a 

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.530 
jaunty little marching tune, whistled by 

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.380  
the tiny, tinny piccolo:

00:14:45.049 --> 00:14:48.839 
And so on. Another surprise. 

00:14:48.839 --> 00:14:51.720  
You see, most musical jokes are surprises, 

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:54.269 
just as most other jokes are; you expect 

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.619 
one thing and get another, and 

00:14:55.619 --> 00:14:57.419 
somehow that tickles your funny bone. 

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:58.810 
Why? Nobody knows. 

00:14:58.810 --> 00:14:58.910
SKIPPED Experts have tried to explain this for centuries, and they still don't know why surprises are funny.

00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:00.269 
And this surprising, 

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:03.869 
silly 2nd theme is even sillier 

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.560  
when it comes back in the recapitulation 

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:05.660  
SKIPPED (in the tonic key, of course!) --

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.369 
because this time it’s played not 

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:11.429 
by the piccolo but by one solo 

00:15:11.429 --> 00:15:14.279 
violin, forcing out his squeaky 

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.079 
little tune over the accompaniment of a 

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.390
whole brass section:

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.050  
It’s like Mickey Mouse leading a football 

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:39.910 
cheer -- that high, puny voice competing 

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.000 
with a brass band. And speaking 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.850 
of the brass band, my favorite joke of the 

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.340  
whole movement is made by that hefty 

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.640  
trombone who introduces this 

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.530 
tune each time it comes with those 

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.000 
pompous two notes:

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:57.910
As you’ll see when 

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.280 
we play the whole movement, all through 

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.470 
this section of the recapitulation 

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.540 
leading up to the squeaky 2nd theme, 

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.570
that trombone keeps plowing in with his 

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.120
2 notes, always in the wrong places, 

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.640 
as though he’s skipped 50 bars of music, 

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.970   
and has come in too soon:

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:31.010  
Poor man -- absolutely lost! But he 

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.280 
doesn't give up -- he keeps trying -- like 

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:36.710 
Pluto in those cartoons.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:52.860
Heaven be praised! He's made it at last. And the cartoon 

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.800 
ends in a burst of pride and glory.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.690  
Naturally I can't tell you all the jokes 

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.060  
in advance; I've got to leave some for you 

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.490 
to discover yourselves. Which I hope 

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.260
you will, as you listen to this delightful first 

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.140 
movement of the 9th Symphony by Dmitri 

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.210 
Shostakovich.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.760  
The second movement of this 9th 

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.520 
Symphony by Shostakovich doesn't seem to 

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.010
be a joke at all. It's a quiet, 

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.610  
sweet little waltz, actually rather sad. 

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.250  
There is no horseplay here, as there was with 

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.990  
the trombone in the first movement -- in 

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.640  
fact, the trumpets and trombones don’t 

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.770
play at all in this piece, and neither 

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.260 
does the percussion. It’s all on a 

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.570 
smaller scale, almost like chamber music, 

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.390  
with haunting long melodies played by 

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.790 
solo woodwinds. It opens with 

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.300
this clarinet solo:

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.050  
And so it goes, wending its melancholy 

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:34.050 
way. Later that long line is 

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.540 
repeated by the solo flute and at the 

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.090 
very end by our old friend the piccolo 

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:43.680  
who has changed from his perky personality 

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.490 
into this gentle, wistful one. And in 

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:49.590  
between these different woodwind solos, 

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.500  
the strings play strange, yearning waves 

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.210 
of melody:

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.210
Rather brooding, isn’t it? 

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:22.290 
Very Russian. Now certainly none of this 

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.930
material sounds particularly humorous or 

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:27.420 
jokey. Then where does the humor 

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:29.070 
come in? Didn’t I say that this whole 

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:32.100 
symphony was a comedy? And I suppose you're going to hold me to it? -- All right -- let me 

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.950 
explain. The humor of this movement is 

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.960  
that it doesn’t belong in a 

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.060 
symphony at all -- especially a Ninth 

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.150 
Symphony. With its reduced, chamber-size 

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.370  
orchestra and its sad little waltz-

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.380  
themes, it’s more like what used to be 

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.380
called Salon Music -- that is, music not so 

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.350  
much for the concert-hall as for hotel-

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:54.900 
lobbies and old-fashioned restaurants, 

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.540  
or for a private, elegant tea-party. 

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.700  
It’s a piece that might have been called, 

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.200 
in times gone by, 

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.260 
"Valse Mélancolique" -- 

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.300
which doesn’t just mean a melancholy 

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.630  
waltz, but suggests a whole era of grand, 

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.300 
faded elegance. And the fact that 

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.980 
Shostakovich puts this 

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.440  
into his 9th Symphony shows a very 

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.870 
subtle brand of humor -- nothing to make 

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.790 
you fall on the floor with laughter, but 

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.910  
to fill you with a light, sweet, 

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:25.350  
unexpected pleasure. Again, it’s the 

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.300
unexpected quality of it that makes you 

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.170 
smile, even a melancholy smile. So here is 

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.860  
the very unsymphonic 2nd movement of this most 

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.060  
unusual symphony.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:48.070  
Pretty, charming, sweet music -- and anything 

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:50.830
but symphonic. But 

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.490 
now, enough of melancholy; from here on in, 

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.100   
the jokes fly thick and fast. The three 

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.170 
movements which conclude this 

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.630 
symphony are all joined together, and played 

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.930 
continuously, like one big stream of fun. 

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.510  
First there is the scherzo -- the 

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.429 
traditionally humorous movement that 

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:12.010  
occurs in almost every symphony. In fact, 

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.909 
the word scherzo means "joke" in Italian; 

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:18.100  
and Shostakovich's scherzo is no 

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.100  
exception. It’s fast and gay and brilliant, 

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.679 
full of rollicking rhythms, delicious 

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:26.290  
wrong notes and startling twists of 

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.600 
harmony. And right in the middle of this 

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.510 
playful movement, there is suddenly a 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.450  
standing Spanish rhythm, over which a 

00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.970
solo trumpet blares out an astonishing 

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:41.600  
Spanish-type tune, like bull-fight music:

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:12.490
Now what in the world is a Spanish 

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:15.700
bullfighter doing in this symphony? Well, 

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.349 
as I said, it's full of surprises; 

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:19.869 
anything can happen. It's as though 

00:35:19.869 --> 00:35:21.730 
suddenly, at a party, someone grabbed the 

00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.619  
Spanish shawl off the piano, wrapped 

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:25.930
himself in it, and gave out with a wild 

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:30.339
gypsy dance. But the best joke of 

00:35:30.339 --> 00:35:32.740 
the scherzo is still to come:

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.990 
it simply dies. Imagine, this

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.109  
rollicking piece suddenly winds down, like 

00:35:38.109 --> 00:35:40.630 
an old phonograph, and comes to an 

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.700
embarrassed stop on the most unlikely 

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:45.520  
note, as if it didn’t know quite what to 

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.160 
do or where to go. And where it does go 

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.530  
is the most unexpected place of all -- 

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.530 
straight into the 4th movement, 

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.550 
which is a total surprise. It’s only 2 

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:57.070 
pages long — you can’t really even call it 

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.980 
a movement; but in those 2 pages we 

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.190
find the main joke of the whole symphony: 

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.839 
the music suddenly becomes slow 

00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:07.089 
and pompous and solemn. Imagine, in the 

00:36:07.089 --> 00:36:09.460  
middle of this happy little symphony, the 

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.670   
trombones, with all their might, thunder out 

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.130  
a majestic fanfare, as if to introduce 

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:18.660 
some great tragic utterance:

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.990
Good heavens, what a change! Is this joke-

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.660
symphony really going to pieces? What are we 

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.549 
doing with great utterances? 

00:36:43.549 --> 00:36:46.069   
Well, let's see what this tragic 

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:48.740 
statement turns out to be:	

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.470  
it’s a bassoon solo, in a free reciting 

00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.210  
style, very mournful and very tragic.

00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:08.210 
Now that doesn’t seem to belong in this 

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.609 
symphony any more than that Spanish 

00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:13.730 
Fandango we heard before. But why just this 

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:15.619 
bassoon solo? I’ll tell you: it’s a 

00:37:15.619 --> 00:37:18.140 
private musical joke. Because what 

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.140
Shostakovich is doing is imitating a similar 

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.990
passage in Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony -- 

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:25.970  
the part that introduces the famous Ode 

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:36.130 
to Joy (SING). Of course you know that. 

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:41.690 
Well, just before it, there is this 

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.000  
recitation by the cellos and basses:

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.049  
And now here Shostakovich 

00:38:04.049 --> 00:38:07.349 
has his mournful bassoon doing 

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:09.940
much the same thing, even in the same key, -- 

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:14.940
--, as if to say, this is going to be a real 

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.519  
Ninth Symphony, tragic and monumental and 

00:38:17.519 --> 00:38:20.700  
everything! Just like Beethoven! And then he has 

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.250  
his trombones repeat the pompous fanfare, 

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.890  
and again the bassoon wails out 

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.769  
his cadenza, only even more mournful now, 

00:38:28.769 --> 00:38:33.180  
more Russian, more emotional. And that’s 

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.099  
the end of the whole 4th movement, 

00:38:35.099 --> 00:38:38.339  
because, super-surprise of all, this same 

00:38:38.339 --> 00:38:40.890  
mournful bassoon, without so much as 

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.940  
drawing breath, (BASSOON HOLD C-flat) slyly sneaks 

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.920  
into a saucy little dance-tune --

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:14.690  
And the tune gradually gathers momentum, as 

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.950 
little by little the whole orchestra 

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:18.350  
picks it up, until soon we're galloping 

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:20.690
away into the 5th and final movement, 

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.480 
which is a brilliant, breathless Rondo.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.230  
And so it turns out that after all, that 

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.910
pompous little 4th movement was just 

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.270 
a decoy, to lure us into expecting a real 

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.090  
Ninth Symphony, a great Beethovenish 

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:37.520 
one -- and then to find that it's 

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.470  
still only that same darling little 

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.900  
Shostakovich Ninth! 

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:44.480  
It's like sitting down to a big serious 

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.180  
banquet, and being served hotdogs and 

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:50.120 
potato chips. Some people might not 

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:52.820 
think that very funny, either; but I'm 

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.680  
sorry for them; they won’t get 

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.840   
the joke in this symphony. You have 

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.340  
to have as much of a sense of humor to 

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.830  
appreciate this music as Shostakovich 

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.110  
had to have in order to write it. And I 

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.240
very much hope you do, so that you 

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.010  
can now enjoy these concluding 3 

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.950 
movements -- that Spanish Scherzo, 

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.470
then the pompous trombone-and-bassoon 

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.220 
bit, and the exciting final joyride. Happy 

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.130 
listening! And Happy Birthday: Dmitri 

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.000 
Shostakovich!

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.960  
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)> From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center -- 

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.310
