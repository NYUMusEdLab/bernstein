I'd half expected to turn00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000around and see everybody doing the samba,00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000or something, up and down the aisles. As00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000this Latin American music is almost00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000irresistible, when it's good like the Batuque00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000we just heard by the Brazilian00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000composer Fernandez. It has a way of00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000stirring up the blood, not only our North-00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000American blood, but people's blood all00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000over the world. Ever since I can remember00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000there's always been an international00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000craze of some kind for Latin American00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000dance music from the old Argentine tango,00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000which swept the world during my00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000childhood, all the way through the rumba,00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000the samba, the conga, the mambo, the00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000cha-cha, pachango [pachanga], merengue, right up to00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000the present excitement over something00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000called the bossa nova. What is it00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000that makes this music from South and00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000Central America so exciting? Well, there00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000are two ingredients that give this music00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000it's special Latin flavor: rhythm and00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000color. Now the first of these, rhythm,00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000doesn't mean just the beat, that00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000insistent, obsessive beat, but the00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000complicated rhythms that go on over the00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000beat. For instance, in this Batuque we just00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000played, you heard a fascinating beat that went: 00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.000It's already pretty00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000exciting, not only because it keeps00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000repeating insistently, but because it has00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000that syncopated accent: one two three00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000FOUR, one two three FOUR...00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000I'm sure a lot of you remember what00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000syncopation means from our other00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000programs of ours we've given. The00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000syncopation is an accent that falls00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000where it doesn't belong, the way you00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000don't expect it: one two three FOUR, one00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000two three FOUR. You expected a one and it00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000falls on four. That's exactly what00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000happens in this Batuque beat:00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000But over that syncopated beat there are00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000rhythms that are even more syncopated00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000and more complicated like this one:00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000So, what with one syncopation and another it00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000turns into a pretty hectic boxing match,00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000with sudden lefts and rights hitting00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000you where and when you least expect00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000them. And that, plus the insistent00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000repetition of the beat, explains why you00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000want to get up and dance when you hear00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000this kind of music.00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000The second element that we find so00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000attractive in Latin American music00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000is all that special00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000instrumental color. It's unmistakable.00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000You're never in doubt about what kind00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000of music you're listening to the moment00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000you hear, for instance, this colorful00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000little sound: 00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.000Now that's a pair of00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000maracas, and what's a rumba or a samba00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000without a pair of maracas? The same is00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000true of that well-known dry little sound00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000you get from getting two sticks together,00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.500what the Cubans call "claves":00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000And then there are all kinds of gourds, like this:00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.000and rasping sticks00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000and an endless variety of other things, like conga drums00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000and bongos that make the music sound00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000Latin. Now actually, I'm not crazy about00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000that word "Latin" to describe this00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000kind of music, because it tells only part00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000of the story. When we speak of Latin00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000America, we are of course referring to00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000the historical fact that these countries00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000were conquered, settled, and exploited by00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000invaders from Latin countries like Spain,00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000or, as in the case of Brazil, from00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000Portugal. And that's why Spanish and00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000Portuguese are still the official00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000languages of our friends to the south of00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000us. Those languages are called Latin00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000languages because they developed from00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000the old language of ancient Rome. But the00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000Latin American spirit -- which is our00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000subject today -- has other ancestors00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000besides the Latin ones, least as00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000important.00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000They are first of all the Indians,00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000the original inhabitants of those00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000countries -- and in some cases very strong00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000civilizations in themselves -- and secondly,00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000Africans are a tremendously important00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000influence, at least as important as it is00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000in our own country. And it's the mingling00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000of these different ancestors, influences,00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000and heritages, which makes the Latin-00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000American spirit what it is, at any rate00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000in music. But we mustn't begin to think00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000that all Latin American music is only00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000"chaka-chaka-chaka-chaka" dance music -- not00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000by a long shot. Our Latin neighbors have00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000produced a very impressive number of00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000serious, symphonic composers, who have00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000succeeded in presenting the folk flavor00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000of their own countries, while at the same00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000time expanding their music into what we00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000think of as universal art -- that is music00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000that has not only a nationalistic spirit00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000but the spirit of all mankind. Certainly00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000the most admired of all these composers00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000was the great Brazilian Villa-Lobos, who00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000died only three years ago, leaving many00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000beautiful compositions; and we're now00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000going to hear the most famous one -- the00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000Bachianas Brasileiras No. 5.00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000That's a mouthful of a title; but it's00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000simple to understand; "Bachianas" simply00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000means "pieces like Bach" -- the great German00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000composer Bach -- in other words, "Bachian"00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000pieces, "Bachianas" in Portuguese.00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000And Brasileiras means Brazilian,00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000naturally. And #5 means that he00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000wrote almost a dozen different works00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000using this title, of which this is the00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.0005th. So there you have it: Bachianas Brasileiras00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000No. 5. Now, what is Bach doing00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000in Brazil? Well, that's just the point of00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000this piece, and really, the point of all00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000the pieces Villa-Lobos composed: he wanted00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000to bring together his native folklore00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000elements with the great European musical00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000tradition and unify them into a single00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000style of his own, as he does in the very00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000title of this piece, Bachianas00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000Brasileiras. And it's amazing how well he00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000succeeded, as you will hear, especially in00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000the first movement. There are two movements00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000to this piece, which by the way is written for a00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000soprano voice and an orchestra00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000consisting of nothing but eight cellos!00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000Now, in the first movement which is slow00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000and tender, he has the soprano sing a long,00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000melodic line, without words -- just the00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000syllable "ah."00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000And underneath, the eight cellos accompany this Bachian song like00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000one huge guitar. Then comes a short00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000middle part that does have words, in00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000Portuguese, about the moon; but then the00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000singer goes back to the wordless Bachian00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000melody, only this time, instead of00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000singing "ah," she hums it. All together,00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000it makes a haunting and unforgettable00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000atmosphere. Then comes the second00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000movement, which is much more Brazilian00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000than Bachian -- it's a fast, gay tongue-00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000twister that does sound like a native00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000folk-dance. And now this difficult and00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000fascinating work will be sung for us by00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000the brilliant Israeli soprano, Netania00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000Davreth.00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000Well, so far, so far our music has been00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000all Brazilian, which seems natural since00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000Brazil is the largest Latin-American00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000country. But I don't want to give you the00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000impression that it's the main source of00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000Latin American music. Every single Latin00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000American country, without exception, has00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000produced fine, serious composers, from00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000Mexico to the tip of Chile. But perhaps00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000Mexico and Cuba have been in the lead,00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000possibly because of their closeness to00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000our musical centers, or possibly because00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000they have such great international00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000cities of their own. Actually, our next00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000piece of Latin music, strangely enough,00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000comes from both countries. Since it was00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000written by a Mexican composer, named Revueltas,00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000but was based on a poem by a00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000Cuban poet, named Guillén. It's a poem, in00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000which he remembers Africa and African00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000tribal rituals -- a weird sort of chant00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000about killing a deadly snake. But this00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000strange and terrifying piece, which is00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000called Sensemayá, combines all00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000the influences we've spoken of: African,00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000and Indian, and European. You see, it's the00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000work of a sophisticated composer with a00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000very advanced technique, like Villa-Lobos,00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000but he's handling an idea of savage00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000primitiveness. And all that savagery and00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000violence is to be heard in the wild00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000rhythms and shrieks, and howls of the00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000orchestra that you will hear, but they00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000are all controlled by the knowing hand00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000of a real artist. It's much more00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000complicated, more syncopated, more00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000difficult than either of the pieces we00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000have heard so far. But Revueltas was00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000a real artist, who died tragically young,00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000at the age of 40; and to judge by this00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000short but thrilling piece we're going to00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000hear, he might have achieved true00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000greatness, if he had lived. Here is his00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000African-Indian-Cuban-Mexican poem for00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000orchestra,00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000Sensemayá.00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000For the second part of our program, we're00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000going to turn the tables, and salute00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000Latin America by playing music written00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000by North American composers under the00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000influence of Latin America. As I said00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000before, we up here have always been00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000enchanted by those Latin colors and00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000rhythms, which have crept into our music,00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000just as naturally as jazz did. And this00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000is especially true of the music of our00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000leading American composer, Aaron Copland.00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000Copland's an old friend of ours by now,00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000since as you may remember, we had an00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000entire program of his music two years00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000ago to celebrate his 60th birthday, when,00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000among other things, we played his famous00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000El Salón México,00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000which is one of his musical souvenir of a00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000Mexican visit. Now, this time, we're going00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000to play a delightful short piece by00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000Copland that isn't heard as often as it00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000ought to be. This one is a souvenir of00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000his Cuban visit, and it's called Danzón00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000Cubano, which doesn't mean "Cuban dance," 00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000but "Cuban Danzón," which is a little00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000different. A danzón is a special kind00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000of dance in two clearly separated parts.00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000The first part is always very elegant,00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000restrained, and crisp;00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000it's wonderful to watch the Cubans do it00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000in their dance halls, because whatever00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000social background they may come from,00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000they look like princes and princesses as00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000they dance the danzón -- very straight00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000and aristocratic, making clean, tiny00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000movements. Then suddenly, the dancers make00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000a little pause, while they gently apply00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000their handkerchiefs to their moist upper00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000lip, very daintily --00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000even the huskiest truck drivers -- for00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000all the world like 18th century00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000courtiers. Then, without any signal, as00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000if by magic, they begin to dance part two,00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000which is usually a bit faster and more00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000exciting. But right to the end, they never00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000lose that royal bearing and control.00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000If we can ever go to Havana again, I hope00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000you'll all get a chance to see a Cuban00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000danzón in action. In the meantime, here is00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000Aaron Copland's symphonic version of the00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000Danzón Cubano.00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000That's pretty hot stuff. Now most of the00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000music we played so far has probably not00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000been very familiar to you. So now, we're00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000going to play something that may be a00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000little more familiar to you: some of the dance00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000music I wrote for "West Side Story." A lot00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000of my music does show Latin American00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000influences, but the music of "West Side00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000Story" is particularly Latin, which is00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000only natural, since the story of this00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000show is, in a great part, about Puerto00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000Ricans. We're going to play you four of00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000the dances from that show, in a special00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000new symphonic orchestration. The first00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000two of these dances are straight out-and-00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000out Latin dance forms: a mambo and a00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000cha-cha. But the interesting thing to me00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000is to hear how Latin-influenced the other00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000dances are, which are not mambos or00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000anything. For instance, in the jazz piece00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000called "Cool," there are hints of bongos00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000and other Latin sounds -- and this is a00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000piece that even has a serious fugue in00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000it. Even in the Rumble, which is00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000simply ballet music that tells part of00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000the story,00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000you'll hear rhythms that will probably00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000make you think of Cuba and Mexico. Which00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000all goes to prove that the word "America"00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000means much more than only the United00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000States: that North America, South America,00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000and Central America are, or ought to be, a00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000solid, united hemisphere. But let's not00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000get into politics. Let's get into the00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000Latin American spirit with the "Mambo"00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.500from West Side Story.00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000<v (ANNOUNCER (V.O.)> From Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center,00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000another of the New York Philharmonic00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000Young People's Concerts under the musical00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000direction of Leonard Bernstein was00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000titled "The Latin American Spirit" and00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000presented works by Fernandez, Revueltas,00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000Villa-Lobos, Copland, and Bernstein.00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000Earlier during this sixth year of00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000televised concerts in the Young People's00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000Series, the program titled "Young00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000Performers" featured four young pianists00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000in concertos by Mozart and Liszt; the00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000music of Wagner, Mozart, Hindemith, and00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000Brahms was presented in the program "What00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.000Is a Melody"; and the "Sound of a Hall"00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000featured works by Berlioz, Copland,00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000Vivaldi, Walton, and Tchaikovsky. The00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000preceding program was pre-recorded at00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000Philharmonic Hall in New York City and00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000was produced and directed by Roger00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.000Englander.
