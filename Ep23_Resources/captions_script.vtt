<v (ANNOUNCER (V.O.)>
(ON CUE)
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center, 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
home of the world's greatest musical 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
events, the Shell Oil Company brings you the NEW YORK 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
PHILHARMONIC YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCERTS 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
under the musical direction of Leonard 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Bernstein.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein. 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
<v Bernstein>
I'm surprised to find you all in 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
your seats. I'd half expected to turn 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
around and see everyone doing the Samba, 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
or something, up and down the aisles.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This Latin-American music is almost 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
irresistible, when it's good, like the "Batuque" 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
we just heard, by the Brazilian 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
composer Fernandez. It has a way of 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
stirring up the blood, not only our North-

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
American blood, but people's blood all 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
over the world. Ever since I can remember 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
there's always been an international 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
craze for some kind of Latin-American 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
dance music, from the old Argentine tango, 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which swept the world in my 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
childhood, all the way through the rhumba, 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the samba, the conga, the mambo, the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
cha-cha, the merengue, the pachango, right up to 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the present excitement over something 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
called Bossa Nova. What is it 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that makes this music from South and 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Central America so exciting? Well, there 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
are two elements that give this music 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
its special Latin spirit: rhythm and color. 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
color. The first of these, rhythm, 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
doesn't mean just the beat, that 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
insistent, obsessive beat, but the 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
complicated rhythms that go on over the 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
beat. For instance, in this Batuque we just

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
played, you heard a fascinating beat: 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which is already pretty 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
exciting, not only because it keeps 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
repeating, but because it has 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
that syncopated accent 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I'm sure a lot of you remember what 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
syncopation means from other 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
programs we've given; a 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
syncopation is an accent that falls 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
where it doesn't belong, or where 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it's not expected:	

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(SING-) one, two, three, four. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And that's exactly what 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
happens in this Batuque beat 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But over that syncopated beat there are 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
rhythms that are even more syncopated 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and complicated. And there are more.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
So, between one syncopation and the other, between the beat and the different rhythms over it, it 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
turns into a pretty hectic boxing match 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
with unexpected lefts and rights hitting 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
you where and when you least expect 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
them. And that, plus the insistent 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
repetition of the beat, explains why you 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
want to get up and dance when you hear

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
this music.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The second element that we find so 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
attractive in Latin-American music 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
is all those special 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
instrumental colors. They're unmistakable.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
You're never in doubt about what kind 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of music you're listening to the moment 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
you hear this colorful 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
little sound: That's a pair of 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
maracas, and what's a rhumba or a samba 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
without maracas? The same is 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
true of that well-known dry sound 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you get from hitting two sticks together -- 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.000
what the Cubans call "claves." And then 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
there are all kinds of gourds 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and rasping sticks 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and an endless variety of drums 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and bongos that make the music sound 

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Latin. Now actually I'm not crazy about 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
that word "Latin" to describe this 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
kind of music, because it tells only part 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of the story. When we speak of "Latin 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
America" we are of course referring to 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the historical fact that these countries 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
were conquered, settled, and exploited by 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
invaders from Latin countries: Spain -- 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
or as in the case of Brazil from 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Portugal. That's why Spanish and 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Portuguese are still the official 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
languages of our friends to the south of 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
us:	and those languages are called "Latin" 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
languages because they developed from 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
the old language of ancient Rome. But the 

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Latin-American spirit -- which is our 

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
subject today -- has other ancestors 

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
besides Latin ones, at least as 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
important; 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and they are first of all Indian, -- 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the original inhabitants of these 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
countries, and in some cases very strong 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
civilizations in themselves -- and secondly, 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
African, a tremendously important 

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
influence, at least as important as it is 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
in our own country. And it is the mingling 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of these different ancestors, influences, 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and heritages, which makes the Latin-

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
American spirit, at least in music.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
SKIPPED
The sweet simple primitiveness of the Indian music mixes with the wild, syncopated, throbbing primitiveness of the African music; and both of these, mixed with the fiery flash of Spanish music,and the sentimental sweetness of Portuguese songs, all together make the music we know as Latin-American."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
But we mustn't begin to think 

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that all Latin-American music is only 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
dance music -- not 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
by a longshot. Our Latin neighbors have 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
produced an impressive number of 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
serious symphonic composers, who have 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
succeeded in preserving the folk-flavor 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
of their own countries, while at the same 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
time expanding their music into what we 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
think of as universal art -- music 

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that has not only a nationalistic spirit 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but the spirit of all mankind. Certainly 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the most admired of all these composers 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
was the great Brazilian Villa-Lobos, who 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
died only three years ago, leaving many 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
beautiful compositions; and we're now 

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
going to hear the most famous one -- the 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Bachianas Brasileires No. 5. 

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now that's a mouthful of a title; but it's 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
simple to understand; Bachianas simply 

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
means "pieces like Bach" -- the great German 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
composer Bach in other words, "Bachian" 

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
pieces; Brasilieres means Brazilians, 

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
naturally. And #5 means that he 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
wrote almost a dozen different works 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
using this title, of which this is the 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
5th; so there you have it, Bachianas Brasilieres

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
No. 5. Now what is Bach doing 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
in Brazil? Well, that's just the point of 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
this piece, and really of all 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
the pieces Villa-Lobos composed; he wanted 

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
to bring together his native folk-lore 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
elements with the great European musical 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
tradition, and unify them in a single 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
style of his own, as he does in the very 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
title of this piece. 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And it's amazing how well he 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
succeeded, as you will hear, especially in 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the first movement. There are two movements 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
in this piece, 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
which by the way is written for a 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
soprano voice and an orchestra 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
consisting of nothing but 8 cellos!

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now, in the first movement, which is slow 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and tender, he has the soprano sing a long, 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
melodic line, without words — just the 

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
syllable Ah.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.100
SKIPPED
-- a beautiful non-repeating melody -- do you remember about non-repeating melodic lines from our program on melody last fall? And do you remember that I used a melody from Bach's Italian Concerto to illustrate what I meant by a long, non-repeating line? Well, Villa-Lobos uses it too, -- not that melody, of course, but one of his own, in the Bach style.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And underneath, the 8 cellos accompany the Bachian song like 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
one huge guitar. Then there's a short 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
middle part, that does have words, in 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Portuguese, about the moon; and then the 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
singer goes back to the wordless Bachian 

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
melody, only this time, instead of 

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
singing Ah, she hums it.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It makes a haunting, unforgettable 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
atmosphere. Then comes the second 

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
movement, which is much more Brazilian 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
than Bachian -- a fast, gay, tongue-

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
twister that does sound like a native 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
folk-dance. This difficult and 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
fascinating work will now be sung for us by 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the brilliant Israeli soprano, Netania 

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Davreth.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Well, so far our music has been 

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
all Brazilian, which seems natural since 

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Brazil is the largest Latin-American 

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
country; but I don't want to give you the 

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
impression that it's the main source of 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Latin American music. Every single Latin American 

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
country, without exception, has 

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
produced fine, serious composers, from 

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Mexico to the tip of Chile. But perhaps 

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Mexico and Cuba have been in the lead, 

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
possibly because of their closeness to 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
our musical centers, or possibly because 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
they have such great international 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
cities of their own. Our next 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
piece of Latin music 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
comes, strangely enough, from both countries. Since it was 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
written by the Mexican composer, Revueltas, 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
but was based on a poem by a 

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Cuban, named Guillen -- 

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
a poem that goes back to African 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
tribal rituals and is a wierd sort of chant 

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
about killing a deadly snake. But this 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
strange and terrifying work, which is 

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
called Sensemaya, combines all 

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
the influences we spoke of — African, 

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Indian, and European. It is the 

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
work of a sophisticated composer, with a 

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
very advanced technique, 

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
treating a theme of savage 

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
primitiveness. And all that savagery and 

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
violence is to be heard in the wild 

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
rhythms and shrieks, and howls of the 

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
orchestra -- but 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
all done by the knowing hand 

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
of a real artist. It's much more 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
complicated, more syncopated, more 

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
difficult than either of the pieces we 

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
have heard so far. Revueltas was 

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
a real artist, who died tragically young, 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
at the age of 40; and to judge by this 

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
short but thrilling piece we are now going to 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
hear, he might have achieved true 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
greatness, if he had lived. Here is his 

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Indian-African-Cuban-Mexican poem for 

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000
orchestra, 

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Sensemaya.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
For the second part of our program, we're 

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
going to turn the tables, and salute 

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Latin America by playing music written 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
by North-Arnerican composers under the 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Latin-American influence. As I said 

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000
before, we've always been 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
enchanted by those Latin colors and 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
rhythms, and they've crept into our own music, 

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
just as naturally as jazz did. This 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
is especially true of the music of our 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
leading American composer, Aaron Copland.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
He is an old friend of ours by now, 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
since as you may remember, we had an 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
entire program of his music two years 

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
ago, to celebrate his 60th birthday. 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
This time we are going 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
to play a delightful short piece by 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Copland that isn't heard as often as it 

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
ought to be: it's called Danzon 

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Cubano, which doesn't mean "Cuban Dance" 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
but "Cuban Danzon", which is a little 

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
different. A danzon is a special kind 

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
of dance in two clearly separated parts; 

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
the first part is always very elegant, 

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
restrained, and crisp; 

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
it's wonderful to watch Cubans do it 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
in their dance halls; because whatever 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
social background they come from, 

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
they look like princes and princesses as 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
they dance, very straight 

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
and aristocratic, with clean, tiny 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
movements. Then there comes 

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
a little pause, while the dancers gently apply 

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
their handkerchieves to their moist upper lip, 

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
for all the world like 18th century 

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
courtiers; and then, without any signal, as 

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000
if by magic, they begin to dance part two, 

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
which is usually a bit faster and more 

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
exciting. But right to the end they never 

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
lose that royal bearing and control; 

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
and if we can ever go to Havana again, I hope 

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
you'll all get a chance to see a Cuban 

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Danzon in action. In the meantime, here is 

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Aaron Copland's symphonic version of the 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Danzon Cubano.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Now probably most of the 

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
music we have played so far has not 

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
been very familiar to you; so now we are 

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
going to play something that may be 

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
more familiar — some of the dance 

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
music from "West Side Story." A lot 

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
of my music shows Latin American 

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
influences, but the music of "West Side 

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Story" is particularly Latin, which is 

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
only natural since the story of this 

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.000
show is in great part about Puerto 

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Ricans. We're going to play you four of 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
the dances from that show, in a special 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
new symphonic orchestration. Now 

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
two of these dances are straight out-and-

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
out Latin dance-forms:	the Mambo and the

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Cha-cha, which you'll hear first. But the interesting thing 

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
is to hear how Latin-influenced the other 

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
dances are, which are not Mambos, or 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
anything. For instance, in the jazz piece 

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
called "Cool" there are hints of bongos 

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
and other Latin sounds; even in the Rumble, which is 

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
simply ballet music that tells part of 

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
the story, you'll hear rhythms that will 

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
make you think of Cuba and Mexico. Which 

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
all goes to prove that the word America 

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
means much more than only the United 

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
States; that North America, South America, 

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
and Central America (and the Caribbean area) are, or ought to be, 

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
a solid United hemisphere.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
<v ANNOUNCER (V.0.)>
From Carnegie Hall... 

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
On this sixth season of 

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
televised concerts of THE YOUNG PEOPLE'S
