<p>The New York Philharmonic’s Young People’s Concerts™ is the longest-running series of family classical music concerts in the world. The series has been beloved by New York families since 1924, when it was founded by conductor “Uncle Ernest” Schelling "to introduce children to the enjoyment of good music, to give them factual information about music and musicians, to stir their imaginations and open new horizons, and to make them music citizens of tomorrow."</p>


<p>However, it wasn’t until 1958 that the Young People’s Concerts became a cultural phenomenon. That year, Leonard Bernstein became Music Director of the New York Philharmonic and proposed that the Young People’s Concerts be televised, bringing Schelling’s mission to an even broader audience and introducing countless children to the world of classical music.</p>


<p>From 1958 to 1972, CBS broadcast 53 episodes of Bernstein’s Young People’s Concerts. Bernstein’s dedication to the series was unparalleled: he scripted and hosted every single episode, continuing the concerts even through his sabbatical year in 1964–65 and after his tenure as Music Director ended in 1969.</p>


<p>The series was wildly successful. At its height, it occupied a primetime television slot, was syndicated in 40 countries, and won four Emmys in four different categories. The “Young Performers” and “Young Composers” series—as well as the active role of Bernstein’s assistant conductors in later episodes—introduced many now-famous musicians to the public, including Seiji Ozawa, Claudio Abbado, James de Preist, André Watts, Lynn Harrell, Edo de Waart, and Shulamit Ran.</p>
