00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
<v ANNOUNCER (V.0)>
(ON CUE)
Shell Oil takes you to the home of the world's greatest musical events -- 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Carnegie Hall in New York City -- 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
for the New 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
York Philharmonic Young People's 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Concerts under the musical direction of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Last year, if you remember, we all 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
had a birthday party here in Carnegie 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Hall in honor of the great composer, 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Gustav Mahler, who would then 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
have been 100 years old. Today, 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we're going to have a 60th birthday 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
party for another composer, our own 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
loved and admired Aaron Copland, and this 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
time we're going to meet him in person 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
later in the program. When you do meet

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
him, I think the first thing about him 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that will strike you is his youthfulness — 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
not only the youthfulness of his face, 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but also of his smile, of his conducting 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
vigor, of his almost boyish personality, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and especially of his spirit. It's almost 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
impossible to list for you all the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
things Mr. Copland has done for the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
young during his lifetime; the dozens of 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
young composers he has rooted for and 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
brought success to; the even more 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
dozens whom he has taught at Tanglewood 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and at Harvard and at other 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
places; and most of all, the many pieces 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
he has written mainly to be performed by 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
young people.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well, today we are going 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to begin our Copland birthday party 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
with a young people's overture -- (of 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
course you remember what an overture is 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
from our last program, I hope) 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.999
-- an overture he wrote 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.000
for the High School of Music and Art 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Orchestra, here in New York City. It's 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
called "AN OUTDOOR OVERTURE," and I think 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you'll understand immediately why he 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
called it "outdoor" when you hear 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
those athletic marchy rhythms, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and those long 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
melodies filled with fresh air and light. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Here is Aaron Copland's OUTDOOR OVERTURE.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now that's what you call an outdoor 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
overture -- it really gets your blood circulating, 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
like a brisk walk in the woods. And it's 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
very typical of Copland -- that easy, fresh 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
style, so open-hearted and frank. But it 

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
shows us only one side of Copland's 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
music, because the truth is that his 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
music is 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
full of variety, like a 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
flower-garden. There are big juicy white 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
flowers, and little thorny ones, and great 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
majestic bushes, and then tiny shy little buds -- 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
all kinds. But perhaps the main 

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
difference in his music is 

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
between the big white ones -- which are so 

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
easy to see and appreciate and even 

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
love, like the overture we just heard -- and 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
those thorny ones that are not so easy to 

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
see and love right off the bat, and are 

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
sort of tricky to handle, especially at 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the first touch. Although some of 

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Copland's greatest compositions are 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
thorny ones, I don't see why we shouldn't 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
play some of them too, especially for 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
this audience of young people; 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
your minds are wide-open to 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
everything, new or old.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Besides, these thorny 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
pieces aren't really so frightening once 

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
you know a little about them. Here's a 

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
short one, for instance, one of a series 

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
of six short pieces for orchestra called 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
simply "STATEMENTS." Each of these 

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
statements has a name describing its 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
own particular feeling, and the one we're 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
going to hear is called *DOGMATIC"--

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
That's a very grown-up word meaning 

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
stubborn, believing firmly in something, 

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and refusing to be talked out of it, 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Dogmatic. So this piece begins with a 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
musical idea that seems made of 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
rock, it's so hard and firm.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Granite. Iron. Dogmatic.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SKIPPED
Well, that hard-boiled idea is the reason for some of the rocky, thorny sounds you will hear in this piece, but not for all of them.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
After all, don't forget that this is modern music, 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
music of our times and we are living in 

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
some pretty rocky times. Besides, music changes 

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and grows all through history, like 

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
all ideas; and what used to be 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
considered right and normal is very 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
different from what's right and normal 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
these days.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000
SKIPPED
For instance that chord we just heard: (PLAY)
That's a rough one, isn't it? I guess Beethoven or Mozart would have thought that one impossible, a dissonance, as it is called.
(PLAY AGAIN)
Modern music. But these days, we're used to it; just see how easy it is to get used to it.
(PLAY 3 or 4 TIMES: pp to ff)
You see? Now it seems quite right and normal. Just because Copland is telling a dogmatic emotion in his music, there's no reason for us listeners to be dogmatic about our musical tastes: we must always be open to new ideas; because ideas in our world are always changing. In the same way, ideas change about what a melody ought to be.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
For instance, in the middle of this piece the brass instruments 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
suddenly blare out a thorny, almost angry theme:

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now that isn't exactly what our elders would have 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
called a "melody", is it? And yet, it is 

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
a melody. Just look. If I change it just a 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
little -- not change the notes, 

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
but only the highness or lowness of them, 

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the theme comes out like this: 

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Now that sounds a bit 

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
less angry already, doesn't it? (Without all that 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
leaping around from low to high to low 

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
again.) But I can make it seem even more 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
normal, more old-fashioned, by 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
putting old-fashioned chords underneath 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:58.000
it, like this. That could have

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.999
been written by Liszt, or anybody, 

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:03.000
100 years ago. But this is music of 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
today; and so Copland doesn't use those

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
harmonies from long ago and also he does

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
make the theme jump furiously from one 

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
register to another, so that it does come 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
out modern, angry and dogmatic. 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And as we play it for you now -- 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the whole thing is less than two minutes 

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
long -- I'd like you to try and feel 

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
like iron, stubborn and 

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
dogmatic, and see if this little piece 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
doesn't completely satisfy that emotion 

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:49.000
you're feeling.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:38.000
COPLAND - STATEMENTS: No. 3 DOGMATIC

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Don't clap. You're not supposed to. It's

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
as if Aaron Copland 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
were saying, "This is what I have to say, 

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and I don't care if you agree with 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
me or not." That's one side of 

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Aaron Copland. But, as I 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
said before, he has many different 

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
sides; and the rest of his pieces on this 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
program are much friendlier ones, as 

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
you will see. And one 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
thing they all have in common is 

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
American-ness. Don't forget that 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Aaron Copland was born in Brooklyn, 

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
which makes him a 200% American; 

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and also that he was born 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
exactly in 1900, the first year of this 

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
century, which makes him 200% 

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
a composer of our time. (Besides, 

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
it makes it so easy to remember how 

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
old he is; he's always just as 

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
old as the year; in 1920 

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
he was 20, in 1940 he was 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
40, and now he's 60 in 1960. Isn't that a 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
lucky break?) Now the first of these

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
American-roots pieces we're going to hear 

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
is a dance from a piece he wrote way back in 

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
1925 -- How old

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
was Copland then?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
That was when he was 

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
first making experiments in using jazz in 

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
symphonic music. This piece is called 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
"MUSIC FOR THE THEATRE"; and the dance 

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
we're going to hear from it is called 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
-- "DANCE". I'm sure I don't have to explain 

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
anything to you about the jazz sounds in 

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
it; you'll hear them right off, plain 

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
as day, -- as soon as those trumpets put on their jazz

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
-mutes, and the drums 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
start their syncopated rhythms, and the 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
little high clarinet begins to squeak 

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:21.000
out this barrelhouse tune: 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
That's real tough big-city music. And to 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
make it even more big-city-ish, Copland has stuck the old tune

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
"East Side. West Side" 

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:31.500
SKIPPED
into the music -- you know it -- (PLAY AND SING)

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
-- only he's modernized the rhythms from a waltz to 5/8 time, 

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:53.000
so that it comes out like this:

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Now did you also hear those funny 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
little notes that were also going on over the 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
tune? That's another modern side to

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
this music — sort of little on-purpose 

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
wrong notes that make you want to laugh.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's about as thorny as this 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
piece ever gets. It's all 

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
meant to be fun — kind of like Coney 

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Island music, or clown music; and I hope 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
you find it as much fun as we do.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
We've just had a jazzy example of

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Copland's music, so now let's turn to one 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
that's just the opposite -- very quiet and 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
serious, but just as American, in another 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
way. In 1940 Copland wrote a beautiful 

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and famous score for a movie called "Our Town" --

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:18.500

I'm sure many of you have seen it, or have maybe seen the original play. 

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
It's about life in a small New Hampshire 

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
town called Grover's Corners, where life 

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
is quiet and sweet and unhurried and very 

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
close to Nature. We're going to hear the 

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
opening music from that film; 

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000

and if it makes you think of church, and hymn-tunes from long ago, well -- you're thinking right, because that's just what he meant. 

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
This is another side of America, another 

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
root, far from the noisy big city we 

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
heard about before; this is the simple 

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
rural American life that is such an 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
important part of our country. Copland 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
has often painted that side of America 

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
for us in his music -- as in his famous

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000
ballet, APPALACHIAN SPRING, or in his 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
opera THE TENDER LAND; but perhaps in 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
this little piece from the film "0ur Town" 

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
he has painted it best of all, because it 

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
seems so real, so quiet, and so deeply 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:29:08.000
felt.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Isn't that a lovely picture of 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
American life -- so different from that jazzy 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
dance we heard before! Now we move on 

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
to an even differenter picture, 

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
just as American in its 

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
roots, but thousands of miles away, in the

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
great West of our country. Copland seemed 

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
to be just as fascinated by the West -- by 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
its exciting history, its pioneer spirit, 

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
the tremendous size of its plains 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
and its mountains -- as he is by our big cities 

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
and small towns. He has written two 

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
very famous ballets about the West: BILLY 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
THE KID and RODEO. We're going to hear now the final dance from RODEO,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
which is called "HOE-DOVN". I guess you all know what 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
a rodeo is, but maybe you don't all know 

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
what a hoe-down is. It's a square dance, 

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
with all the trappings -- fiddlers and 

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
callers and swingin' your partner. 

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
We don't have any callers 

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
here, or any partners to swing, but we 

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
sure do have fiddlers! Wait til 

00:30:19.000 --> 00:32:33.000
you hear them —

00:30:19.000 --> 00:32:33.000
COPLAND - RODEO: HOE DOWN (4:00)

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Now we have a very special birthday 

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
surprise coming up. The great American 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
baritone William Warfield is going to 

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
sing two of Copland's songs for us. These 

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
songs are not really original 

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
compositions, since they are old 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
American folk-songs that almost 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
everybody knows. But Copland has arranged 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
them with his special style and 

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
orchestration and with such a personal 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
understanding and love for them that 

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
they seem to come out as brand-new 

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
pieces by him. I don't know 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
how he does it; it's part of the magic 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
that goes on in this wonderful garden 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
SKIPPED
we are in today. Maybe we could say that that last "HOE-DOWN" is like a big cactus in this garden, with great splashy red flowers blooming on it; but these songs have other American roots, and they come out like little homey, familiar daisies or dandelions; 

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
only Copland's magic touch has given them new color and shape. The names of these 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
two songs are; "SIMPLE GIFTS" and 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:35:11.000
"BOUGHT ME A CAT." Here is William Warfield.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
And now we come to the big climax of our

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
party; we're going to meet 

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Aaron Copland himself, who will conduct 

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
one of his most famous pieces -- "THE 

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
SALON MEXICO" -- 

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
(EL SALON MEJICO) -- which is one of his 

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
very friendliest compositions. 

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.500
SKIPPED
Of course it has little thorns in it, here and there -- certain so called "dissonant" chords, like these --
(PLAY)
or certain tricky modern rhythms, like
these --
(PIANO)
but they're all part of its being modern music, and they won't seem thorny at all when you hear them along with sweet Mexican melodies like this one: 
(PIANO)

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.000
You see, EL SALON MEXICO 

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
is the name of a dance-hall in Mexico City -- 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
sort of like our Roseland -- which Copland 

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
visited once. He was so excited by what 

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
he heard and saw there that he wrote a 

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
piece about it. And so I take tremendous 

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
personal pleasure in welcoming to this 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
podium a great composer, a dear person, a 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
true friend to youth, one who has guided 

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
and encouraged so many young people; 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
including myself when I was just 

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
starting out. My thanks, our thanks, the 

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
thanks of all musicians and music-

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
lovers all over the country, and all over 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:46:15.000
the world. Happy birthday, Aaron Copland!
