# bernstein

This is a platform for analyzing the Leonard Bernstein Young People's Concerts. 

Bugs to Update:
Correct Summary positioning for each episode.
Correct Chapters width for each episode.
Add dimensions to episode buttons.
Implement a "back button" on each episode.
Fix Search-Feature Bug (try reverting)
The search bar doesn't appear to work (Control-F works fine on the webpage, so maybe it's not needed?)
Cannot resize script PDF box, making it difficult to read
Tracking bar doesn't work; to navigate thru video one must rely on chapter sidebar
Not currently possible to view script and transcript at the same time, which might be a useful tool
The volume bar mostly works, but will sometimes stop working randomly. I haven't been able to identify why.
