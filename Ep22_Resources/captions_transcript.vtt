Now this year, again,00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000we found great numbers of brilliant00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000young talents, but as it turned out, they00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000were almost all pianists for some reason.00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000It's like an epidemic, everyone seems to00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000have caught piano fever. So we've decided00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000to present only pianists on this00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.999particular program; four of them, three00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000girls and one boy, who I believe will00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000really make you sit up and take notice.00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000These four artists are going to be heard00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000in two piano concertos, one by Mozart and00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000one by Liszt. Now there's a rather tricky00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000problem in arithmetic, how do you fit four00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000pianists into two concertos? Well it's00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000not really so hard; you see the three00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000young ladies will play one movement each00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000of the Mozart concerto in A Major, which00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000happens to have exactly three movements;00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000and then the young man will play all of00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000the Liszt concerto in E flat major, which00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000is all in only one movement anyway. So00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000you see, it works out very neatly. One00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000other thing; you may also know that we00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000have here at the Philharmonic not one00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000but three young assistant conductors,00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000three new ones each year, whose job it is00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000to be ready at all times to help out at00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000rehearsals and especially be ready to00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000take over if I, or one of our guest00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000conductors, should get sick. Now this00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000doesn't happen very often, luckily for me,00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000but unluckily for them. I know that00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000problem personally from my own00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000experience since I myself started out as00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000the assistant conductor of this very00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000orchestra twenty years ago, and I00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000remember doing a lot of waiting around00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000myself. And so today I'm going to ask all00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000three of our assistants to conduct this00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000Mozart concerto, one movement apiece, so00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000again, you see, the arithmetic works out00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000just perfectly. Now here we go with the00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000brilliant opening movement of the Mozart00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000concerto in A major, to be played by the00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000fourteen-year-old00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000Joan Weiner, who comes to us from Falls00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000Church, Virginia. I think you'll be amazed00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000by the strength and sureness of Miss00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000Weiner's playing, and I bet if you closed00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000your eyes you'd find it hard to believe00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000that this was the performance of a 1400:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000year old girl. The orchestra for this00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000movement will be under the direction of00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000our gifted young assistant conductor, Yuri00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000Krasnopolsky, who despite his Russian00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000sounding name he is a born and bred00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000American. Mr. Krasnopolsky came within00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000an ace of being Dr. Krasnopolsky since00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000he spent many years studying medicine as00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000well as music, but he finally made the00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000great decision and here he is today to00:04:19.000 --> 00:05:14.000accompany Joan Weiner.00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000You know, it - you know it used to be, in00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000the olden days that young ladies by the00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000thousands used to study the piano just00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000as part of good breeding. It was enough00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000if they could play a little piece at a00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000party which was called a social00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000accomplishment. But our three young00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000ladies today have nothing at all to do00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000with that world; they are serious artists,00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000as you have just heard, and are still00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000about to hear. Our next artist is only 1200:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000years old, her name is Claudia Hoca, H-O-C-A;00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000and she will play the lovely, haunting00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000second movement of this same Mozart00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000concerto. Claudia was born in Austria,00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000where her mother lived and taught school;00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000her father was a refugee from the00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000Russian Ukraine, and today they all live00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000happily in Buffalo, New York, where Mr.00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000Hoca is a professor at Niagara00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000University. A very cultured family all in00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000all, and I think you'll find Claudia's00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000performance equally cultured. Our00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000conductor this time is the talented00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000Zoltan Rozsnyai, which would seem to00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000make him Hungarian, which in fact he is.00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000Or rather, he is half Hungarian, and half00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000Austrian, which gives him a certain00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000extra sympathy with Miss Hoca, to say00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000nothing of the greatest Austrian of them00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000all, Mozart. And here they are, Miss Hoca00:17:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000and Mr. Rozsnyai.00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000That is what you call beautiful music,00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000and beautiful playing by beautiful girls.00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000It's going to be hard to follow them; I'd00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000be a little scared myself; but I00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000guarantee that our next young lady will00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000follow them with honors. She is the 1300:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000year-old Pamela Paul, born in New York00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000City, with the extra advantage of having00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000a musician for a father. Still, that00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000shouldn't make too much difference; after00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000all, Joan Weiner's father is a dentist, and00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000Claudia Hoca's father is a professor of00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000Education, and my father's in the beauty00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000parlor business. So I guess there's no00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000strict rule about musician's fathers.00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000This last movement of the Mozart concerto00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000will be conducted by a very promising00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000lad who comes to us from France, Serge00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000Fournier. I know it's rather difficult00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000for you to remember all these strange00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000foreign names of our three assistant00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000conductors, Krasnopolosky, Rozsynai,00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000Fournier, but we here at the Philharmonic are00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000very proud of our international00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000relations. So here is the finale of the00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000Mozart concerto in A major, played by00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000Pamela Paul, conducted by Serge Fournier.00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000And now we come to a young man who is so00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000remarkable that I am tempted to give him00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000a tremendous build-up; but I'd almost00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000rather not so that you might have the00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000same unexpected shock of pleasure and00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000wonderment that I had when I first heard00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000him play. He was just another in a long00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000procession of pianists who were00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000auditioning for us one afternoon, and out00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000he came, a sensitive-faced 16 year old boy00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000from Philadelphia, looking rather like a00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000young Persian prince, who sat down at the00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000piano and tore into the opening bars of00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000a Liszt concerto in such a way that we00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000simply flipped.00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000He is named Andre Watts,00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000and that mixed up name comes from having00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000an American father named Watts and a00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000Hungarian mother, who met each other in00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000Nuremberg, Germany, where Andre's father00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000was stationed with the United States00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000Army. I love that kind of story, I like to00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000believe that international marriages00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000produce highly distinguished human00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000beings. At least this one did, as you are00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000about to hear when Andre plays for you00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000the Liszt concerto in E flat major; but00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000because I admire his playing so much, I'm00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000going to be selfish and take the00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000pleasure of conducting for him myself.00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000Let us welcome, with warmth and pride, Andre Watts.00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center,00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000another New York Philharmonic Young00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000People's Concert under the musical00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000direction of Leonard Bernstein has been00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000presented by the Shell Oil Company. This00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000concert's "Young Performers" featured piano00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000concertos by Mozart and Liszt. The next00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000concert in the Young People series will00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000be presented in seven weeks on Friday,00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.000March 8, at which time Mr.00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000Bernstein's subject will be "The Latin00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000American Spirit." The preceding program00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000was pre-recorded and was produced and00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000directed by Roger Englander. Be sure to00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000see "Shell's Wonderful World of Golf,"00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000starting Sunday afternoon, January00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.00020th on another network. Check your00:53:45.000 --> 00:54:19.000local listings for time and station.
