00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
<v ANNOUNCER: (V.O.)>
(ON CUE)
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
home of the world's greatest musical 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
events, the Shell Oil Company brings you 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC YOUNG PEOPLE'S 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
CONCERTS under the musical direction of 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
<v BERNSTEIN>
As you may know, we 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
devote one Young People's program every 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
year to presenting young performers to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you — young people who are so gifted and 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so well-developed in music that they are 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
already real artists. Now this year, again, 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
we have found great numbers of brilliant 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
young talents, but as it turned out, they 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
were almost all pianists. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's like an epidemic — everyone seems to 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
have caught piano-fever. And so we've decided 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to present only pianists on this 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.999
particular program; four of them, three 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000
girls and one boy, who I believe will 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
really make you sit up and take notice. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
These four artists are going to be heard 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in two piano concertos, one by Mozart and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
one by Liszt. Now there's a tricky 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
problem in arithmetic; how do you fit four 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
pianists into two concertos? Well, it's 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
not so hard; the three 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
young ladies will play one movement each 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of the Mozart Concerto in A Major, which 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
happens to have exactly three movements; 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and then the young man will play all of 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the Liszt Concerto in Eb Major, which 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
has only one movement anyway. So 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
you see, it works out very neatly. One 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
other thing; as you may also know, we 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
have here at the Philharmonic not one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
but three young assistant conductors, — 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
three new ones every year — whose job it is 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to be ready at all times to help out at 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
rehearsals, and be ready to 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
take over if I, or one of our guest 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
conductors, should get sick. Now this 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
doesn't happen very often, luckily for me, 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but unluckily for them. I know this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
personally from my own 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
experience since I started out as 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
assistant conductor of this very 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
orchestra and did a lot of 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
waiting around myself.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And so today I'm going to ask all 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
three of our assistants to conduct this 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Mozart Concerto, one movement each; so 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
again, you see, the arithmetic works out 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
perfectly. Here we go with the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
brilliant first movement of the Mozart 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Concerto in A Major, to be played by the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
14-year-old 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Joan Weiner, who comes to us from Arlington, 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Virginia. I think you'll be amazed 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
by the strength and sureness of Miss 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Weiner's playing; and I bet that if you closed 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
your eyes you'd find it hard to believe 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that this was the performance of a 14-

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
year-old girl. The orchestra 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
will be under the direction of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
our gifted assistant conductor, Yuri 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Krasnopolsky, who despite his Russian 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
sounding name is a born and bred 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
American. (Mr. Krasnopolsky came within 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
an ace of being Dr. Krasnopolsky, since 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
he spent many years studying medicine 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but finally made the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
great decision and gave it all up for music.  think you will agree he made a wise choice.) Here they are. 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Miss Weiner and Mr. Krasnopolsky.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
You know, it used to be, in 

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
the old days, that young ladies by the 

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
thousands studied the piano, 

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
as part of good breeding. It was enough 

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
if they could play a little piece at a 

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
party, as what was called a social 

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
accomplishment. But our three young 

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
ladies today have nothing at all to do

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
with that world; they are serious artists, 

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
as you have just heard, and 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
are about to hear. Our next artist is only 12 

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
years old; her name is Claudia Hoca; 

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and she will play the lovely, haunting 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
second movement of this same Mozart 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Concerto. Claudia was born in Austria, 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
where her mother lived and taught school; 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
her father was a refugee from the 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Russian Ukraine. Today they all live 

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
happily in Buffalo, New York, where Mr. 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Hoca is a professor at Niagara 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
University. A very cultured family all in 

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
all; and I think you'll find Claudia's 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
performance equally cultured.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Our conductor this time is the talented 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Zoltan Rozsnyai, which would seem to 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
make him Hungarian, which in fact he is — Hungarian. 
(It was he who assembled the famous orchestra of Hungarian refugees. 

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Or rather, he is half Hungarian, half 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Austrian, which gives him a certain 

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
extra relation with Miss Hoca, to say 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
nothing of Mozart.) 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Here they are, Miss Hoca and

00:17:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Mr. Rozsnyai.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Beautiful playing by 

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
beautiful girls. 

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
It's going to be hard to follow them; I'd 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
be a little bit scared myself; but I 

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
guarantee that our next young lady will 

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
follow them with honors. She is the 13-

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
year old Pamela Paul, born in New York 

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
City, with the extra advantage of having 

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
a musician for a father. Still, that 

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
shouldn't make too much difference; after 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
all, Joan Weiner's father is a dentist, 

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Claudia Hoca's father is a professor of 

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
education, and my father is in the beauty 

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
parlor business. So I guess there's no 

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
strict rule about musicians' fathers. 

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.500
SKIPPED
But Pamela studies with a great teacher, Professor Steuerman, at the Juilliard School in New York; and when she rips off the sparkling final movement of this Mozart Concerto — which is no child's-play — I'm sure you'll recognize the influence of a fine teacher.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
This last movement 

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
will be conducted by a very promising 

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
lad who comes to us from France, Monsieur Serge 

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Fournier. (I know it's rather difficult 

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
for you to remember all the strange 

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
foreign names of our three assistant 

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
conductors 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
but we here at the Philharmonic are 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
very proud of our international 

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
relations.) So here is the finale of the 

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Mozart Concerto in A Major, played by 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Pamela Paul, conducted by Serge Fournier.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
And now we come to a young man who is so 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
remarkable that I'm tempted to give him 

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
a tremendous build-up; but I'd almost 

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
rather not, so that you might have the 

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
same unexpected shock of pleasure and 

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
wonderment that I had when I first heard 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
him play. He was just another in a long 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
procession of pianists who were 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
auditioning for us that afternoon; and out 

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
he came, a sensitive-faced, 16-year-old boy 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
from Philadelphia, looking rather like a 

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
young Persian prince, who sat down at the 

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
piano and tore into the opening bars of 

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
a Liszt Concerto in such a way that we 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
simply flipped. 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.500
SKIPPED
It was like the first time I heard Van Cliburn, years ago; listening to him play the first three bars of music, you knew you were in the presence of a star. So it is with this young Cliburn, 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
SKIPPED
who is named Andre Watts; 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
and that mixed-up name comes from having 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
an American father and a 

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Hungarian mother, who met each other in 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Nuremberg, Germany, where Andre's father 

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
was stationed with the United States 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Army. I love that kind of story; I like to 

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
believe that international marriages 

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
produce superior human 

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
beings. At least this one did, as you are 

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
about to hear, when Andre plays for you 

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
the Liszt Concerto in Eb Major. And 

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
because I admire his playing so much, I am 

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
going to take the 

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
pleasure and privilege of conducting for him myself. 

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Let us welcome, with warmth and pride, Andre Watts.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)>
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center — 

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
another NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC YOUNG 

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
PEOPLE'S CONCERT under the musical 

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000
direction of Leonard Bernstein has been

concert — "Young Performers" — featured piano 

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000
concertos by Mozart and Liszt. The next 

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
concert in the YOUNG PEOPLE'S series will

Bernstein's subject will be "The Latin 

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
American Spirit." The preceding program 

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
was prerecorded and was produced and 

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.000
