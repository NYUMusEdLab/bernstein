00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
<v ANNOUNCER (VO)>
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
home of the world's greatest musical 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
events --- another program of NEW YORK 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
PHILHARMONIC YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCERTS 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
under the musical direction of Leonard 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Bernstein.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
This special program is being brought to 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you by Polaroid Corporation.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
My dear young friends: Have you heard the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
news? 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Johann Sebastian Bach has made the cover 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of TIME magazine! Yes, 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
right

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
up there along with Presidents, 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
astronauts and Joe Namath - imagine, Bach, 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
old Bach, over 200 years dead! And 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
why? Because they have found out that 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Bach is in - in with old and young, rebels 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and hippies, bookworms and dropouts, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
SKIPPED
Europeans and Americans, concert-givers and concert-goers and even concert-haters. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Everyone who likes music suddenly likes 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.999
Bach, And you know what? Time Magazine is right; only there's nothing so new 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000
about it as to warrant a news-magazine cover story, Bach is always being discovered 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and dropped and rediscovered. It's an old 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.500
story.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500
SKIPPED
For instance: when Bach died in 1750 he was known and honored in some parts of Germany as a fine organist, a splendid court-and-church-composer, and a good teacher. But there was nothing like a golden halo around his name. Not yet. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
His own sons were already composing the music of

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
a new generation, and they thought of 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
their old man as a sort of square. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"The Old Wig", they called him. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They had had it with the fugues and cantatas. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then, 79 years later, after the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
SKIPPED
reign of Classicism, after Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven had almost obliterated Bach from musical memory, a conductor-composer named Mendelssohn trotted out the Old Wig, revived his works and his spirit, and Bach was rediscovered. That was l40 years ago.
Then once again he was swamped by the new stormy waves of Romanticism; he got buried again under his wig, and was again regarded as the Old Man of the Fugue. Whatever popularity he had in the 19th century was mainly due to flashy piano transcriptions of some of his organ and harpsichord pieces by virtuoso performers like Liszt, or to sugary performances of a few sacred works like the St. Matthew Passion. Again, Bach's light was dim. Then, in our own century, there was a new flare-up of interest - but this time the error was in the direction of purism, of being too rigidly faithful, too pedantic. And you can imagine that this didn't exactly bring people thronging to the concert-halls.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now in the 1960's we have a brand new rediscovery of Bach - 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
through a host of new gimmicks 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and treatments and tricks that can be 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
played on him. His music just 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
naturally seems to lend itself to 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
treatments - or transmogrifications,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
whether by the boppy Swingle 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Singers, 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
or Rock and Roll 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
groups, or by way-out composers, or 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
by very serious conductors. And this is 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
what our program is about today; Bach 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
switched on, turned on, rocked, rolled, 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.999
shaken and baked. What you're going 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.000
to hear may astonish some of you, and 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
outrage others - but it can't fail to 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
fascinate you. And the most fascinating 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
thing of all is likely to be the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
incredible strength and joy and spiritual vitality of the 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
original, the Old Mans wiggy music -those 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
magic notes that will last forever.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
OK - let's start by taking a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
famous Bach fugue - the so-called "little" G-

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
minor fugue for organ. We're going to 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
hear it in three ways: first in 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
its pure original form, on the organ, and then in 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
two transmogrifications - 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
one a version for symphony orchestra, and 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the other a rather more kooky version 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
for the much discussed new Moog synthesizer. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But more about that later; let's first 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
listen to the fugue itself, as Bach 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
conceived it, played by a marvelous young

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
organist that we discovered at one of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.999
our auditions, the _______ year old Michael 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:24.000
Korn.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Bravo! That's a fugue you can 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
hear once and never forget. But you're 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
going to hear it three times, in three different ways, 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
so you can be sure you'11 never forget it. Now 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
for the second version:	

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.100
SKIPPED
you remember I said that Bach was famous in the 19th century through those flashy transcriptions for flashy pianists? Well this method of "selling" Bach continued right into the 20th century in the form of flashy transcriptions for orchestras. 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
These were usually made by conductors who were not 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
satisfied with the small number of 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
pieces Bach wrote for orchestra, to say 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
nothing of the smallness of the 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
orchestras he wrote for. Here were 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
these virtuoso conductors with hundred-

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
piece symphony orchestras, and no Bach 

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
for them to play. So, these conductors 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
reasoned, let's give them some, 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
by making big, lavish transcriptions - and 

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
these were usually justified by the 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
reasoning that if Bach were alive today, 

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
with these great, overwhelming orchestra-

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
machines at his disposal, he would 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
certainly have given his music the same 

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
full treatment. I'm not completely sold 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
on this argument, but many other 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
conductors are, most notably the great 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and beloved Maestro Stokowski. He has 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
made many Bach transcriptions over the 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
years and many concert devotees of Stokowski have thought of Bach only in terms of these glamorous transcriptions. One of the most famous ones is of 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
this very G-minor fugue we just heard, 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and so here it is again, switched on in the grand 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Stokowski manner. Of course, ideally, a 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Stokowski transcription should be 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
conducted by Stokowski himself, and 

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
we have been lucky enough to 

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
persuade the great Maestro to come and 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
conduct it for us.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
How's that for a bonus? We are proud 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to welcome none other than Leopold 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Stokowski.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Thank you Maestro. And what a glorious 

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
noise that was. 

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
But is it Bach? Yes, of course: all the notes are Bach's notes.
But -uh- is it Bach? Of course not; Bach1s notes weren't written for oboes and trumpets and drums and things . Now there's an argument you can keep running for hours at some boring dinner-party. 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
But if you are on the side of the purists, 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and you think that's a distortion of 

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Bach, wait 'til you hear the next one - 

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
a transmogrification of the 

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
same fugue on the much talked - 

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and written-about Moog Synthesizer.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
*There has been so much 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
publicity about this fascinating 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
electronic instrument that I feel I don't even have to take time 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to describe it to you.*

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It is now world-famous through its 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
shenanigans on a 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
record-album called Switched-On Bach, 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
in which it is manipulated by its most 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
famous interpreter, Walter Carlos, who is here today to manipulate it for us in person.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
We are happy to welcome ourswitched-on guest artist, Walter Carlos

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Well, I think we've just about had that fugue.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Let's clear the air 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
by going to 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
another famous Bach piece, this 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
time for 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
unaccompanied violin solo -that is, in 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Bach's original version. After which 

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
you're going to hear a 

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
transmogrification of it that may make 

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
your hair stand on end. But first let's 

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
hear at least some of the original - the 

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
opening movement, or 

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Praeludium, of Bach's E-major Partita 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
played by our own concertmaster, 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:22:12.000
David Nadien.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I hate to stop that beautiful playing, but 

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
that's enough to 

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
give you some idea of 

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
the piece, which goes on in much the same 

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
way for four minutes. 

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Now: along 

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
comes one of our best-known and most 

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
talented composers, Lukas Foss, who for 

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
some years has been experimenting with 

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
various new wrinkles in the world of the 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
so-called avant-garde, the way-out 

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
fringes of contemporary music. Mr. Foss, 

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
who is also a conductor, has taken this 

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
well-loved and world-famous bit of 

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
violin music, and has made - not a 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
transcription at all in the Stokowski manner 

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
- but a whole new piece of his own, 

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
in which, astonishingly enough, every note 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
comes from the Bach piece. But the way he 

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
puts these notes together is something 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
else, as you'11 hear in a moment. Foss 

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
calls his piece Phorion - a Greek word 

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
meaning "stolen goods" - thereby emphasizing 

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
the fact that all the notes he uses are 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
stolen - or rather, borrowed - from Bach.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
But he has subjected, these notes to a highly 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
unusual treatment, which I'11 try to 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
explain - and that's no easy job.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
First of all, each member of the orchestra has 

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
two sets of music in front of him: one a 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
sheet containing Bach's original, and the 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
other a complicated set of instructions. 

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
These instructions describe a series of 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
musical events, the length of each event 

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
being more or less up to the whim 

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
of the conductor. Also left to the 

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
conductor's whim are the entrances and 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
exits of the various instrumental groups 

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
in the orchestra - with this one extra special 

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
added attraction that whenever a group 

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
of instruments is cued out by the 

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
conductor, they don't stop playing, but 

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
continue with their Bach notes, only 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
inaudibly, without being heard. Now that may 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
sound impossible, but it's exactly so.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
For instance, the cellos may be playing along

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
when suddenly the conductor gives them the stop sign

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
and they continue to finger the notes, but not to bow them, 

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
thus producing no sound except the tiny 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
tapping of their fingers on the strings. 

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Listen. Meanwhile another group 

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
is cued in, such as clarinets

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
They are cued out and the cellos 

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
cued back in, blooming suddenly into 

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
sound at whatever point they may have 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.999
reached in their inaudible music: 

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:06.000
like this

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
It's a wild idea, but an exciting one, especially when the 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
whole orchestra is doing it together, 

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
creating waves of sound rather like 

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
ocean waves rolling in unpredictably 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
from any and all directions. But there's 

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
much more to this Phorion than that 

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
trick; there are so-called supporting 

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
instruments, mostly brass and winds, that 

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
pick up occasional bits of the string

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
music and join in, sometimes 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
imitating them, sometimes mocking them. 

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Then there are three electric 

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
instruments - guitar, piano and 

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
organ - who have their own separate 

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
instructions. 

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
And then there are different 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
percussion groups placed around the 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
edges of the stage, cymbals, 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
gongs, anvils, what-not - who sometimes 

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000
support the instruments in front of them, 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
and at other times join in a battle with 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
them, making random sounds of knocking, 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
whipping, hammering or breaking. In fact, 

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
the first sound you'11 hear, on the 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
opening downbeat, includes the smashing 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
of a Coca-Cola bottle in a burlap bag. And by 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
the end of the piece, with everyone going 

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
at once for all they're worth, Bach has 

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
been turned into a bloody battlefield of 

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
noise. It's certainly not Bach any more, and 

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I don't even think it winds up being 

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
music in the usual sense, but whatever it 

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
is, it's an intensely personal expression 

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
by a dedicated, talented composer who 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
adores Bach. So if he 

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
seems to you to be murdering Bach, it may 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
be really that he is expressing something 

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
about our century that can be expressed 

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
only by committing this kind of violence 

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
on the music of the past. *Phorion 

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
can amaze us and amuse us, 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
but it can also tell us something 

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
awfully important if we listen with our 

00:27:16.000 --> 00:31:27.000
minds as well as our ears.*

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
So far, in our look at transmogrified 

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Bach, 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
we've spent much more time on the 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
transmogrifications-- than on Bach 

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
himself - which is right, since that's what 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
this program is about. But somewhere 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
along the way we begin to long for a 

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
bit more of the real thing - more than 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
a 3-minute organ fugue and a 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
minute of a solo violin piece. So now, 

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
before our next and final 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
transmogrification (which may turn out to 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
be the wildest of all) let's hear a 

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
good solid hunk of untransmogrified Bach-

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
the opening movement of the Fifth 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Brandenburg Concerto in D major, which is 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000
scored for a small string orchestra

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
with three soloists - violin, flute, 

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
and harpsichord.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Even this performance is 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
going to be somewhat transmogrified, - that 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
is, not exactly as it was heard in Bach's 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
day - since the string instruments are 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
played very differently now from the way 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
they were played then, plus the fact that 

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
the piano has replaced the harpsichord 

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000
as the standard keyboard instrument. 

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Besides we're going to shorten it a 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
bit. The solo parts will be played 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
by David Nadien (who is certainly earning

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
his bread today), by our great solo 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
flautist Julius Baker, and by yours truly at 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
the keyboard. So let's give our undivided 

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
attention to the glories of Bach's 

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
concerto, before we let the N.Y. 

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Rock and Roll Ensemble get their hot 

00:35:03.000 --> 00:37:38.000
hands on it. David! Julie!

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Now at last we turn the stage over 

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
to those five mad geniuses who go by the 

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
name of the N.Y. Rock and Roll 

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Ensemble. They are five hybrids - half blue-

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
blood and half Beatle, half conservatory-

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
trained and half trained in the college 

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
of Hard Rock. I'm not quite sure what 

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
they're going to do with this music we 

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
just presented them with the Fifth 

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Brandenburg Concerto and said: take it 

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
from there. And wherever they take it, 

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
whether you approve or not, one thing is 

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
sure: it's going to be fun. Who knows: 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:46:10.000
it may even be beautiful.
