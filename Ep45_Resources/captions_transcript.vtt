And00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000why? Because they suddenly found out that00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000Bach is in - in with old and young, rebels00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000and hippies, scholars and dropouts,00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000Everyone who likes music suddenly likes00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.999Bach, but actually there's nothing so new00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000about it. Bach, is always being discovered00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000and dropped and rediscovered. It's an old00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000story.00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000He was even dropped by his own sons. They00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000were the first to drop him who thought00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000of him as an old square. In fact they00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000used to call him the "Old Wig" behind his00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000back.00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000And then he wasn't rediscovered until00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000seventy-nine years later, but this latest00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000rediscovery of Bach in the 1960s00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000is supported by a host of new gimmicks00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000and treatments and tricks that can be00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000played on him. Bach's music just00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000naturally seems to lend itself to00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000treatments - or transmogrification,00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000whether it's by the Swingle Sister00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000Singers, I always call them the Swingle00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000sisters, I don't aware or rock-and-roll00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000groups, or by way-out composers, or even00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000by very serious conductors. And this is00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000what our program is about today; Bach00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000switched on, turned on, rocked, rolled,00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.999shaken and baked. And what you're going00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.000to hear may astonish some of you, and00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000outraged others - but it can't fail to00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000fascinate you. And the most fascinating00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000thing of all is likely to be the00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000incredible spiritual vitality of the00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000original, the old man's wiggy music -those00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000magic notes that will last forever. So00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000let's start by hearing an original a00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000famous Bach fugue the so called little G-00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000minor fugue for organ. And we're going to00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000hear it in three different ways: first in00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000its pure form, for the organ and then in00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000two transmogrification -00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000one aversion for symphony orchestra, and00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000the other for a much more kooky version00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000for the newly famous Moog synthesizer.00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000But more about that later; let's first00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000listen to the fugue itself, as Bach00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000conceived it, played by a marvelous young00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000organist that we discovered at one of00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.999our auditions the 21 year old Michael00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:24.000Korn.00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000Bravo! Michael that's a fugue you could00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000hear once and never forget. But you're00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000going to hear it three times, so you can00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000be really sure you'll never forget it. Now00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000about this second version for symphony00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000orchestra: orchestral transcriptions of00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000Bach's organ and harpsichord music are00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000usually made by conductors who were not00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000satisfied with the small amount of00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000pieces Bach wrote for orchestra, to say00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000nothing of the smallness of the00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000orchestras he wrote them for. I hear00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000these virtuoso conductors with hundred-00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000piece symphony orchestras, and no Bach00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000for them to play. So, these conductors00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000reason, let's give them some, Bach to play00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000by making big, lavish transcriptions - and00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000these are usually justified by the00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000reasoning that if Bach were alive today,00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000with these great, overwhelming orchestra-00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000machines at his disposal, he would most00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000certainly have given his music the same00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000full treatment. I'm not completely sold00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000on that argument, but many other00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000conductors are most notably the great00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000and beloved maestro Stokowski. He has00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000made many Bach transcriptions over the00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000years and one of the most famous is of00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000this very G-minor fugue we just heard,00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000and so here it is again in the grand00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000Stokowski manner. Of course, ideally, as00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000Stokowski transcription should be00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000conducted by stakhovski himself, and00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000guess what we have been lucky enough to00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000persuade the great Maestro to come and00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000conduct it for us in person. We are proud00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000to welcome none other than Leopold00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:25.000Stokowski00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:50.000you00:10:50.000 --> 00:12:05.000you00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:37.000you00:12:37.000 --> 00:15:03.000you00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000Thank you maestro. And what a glorious00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000sound that was. But of course if you00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000happen to be on the side of the purists,00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000and you think that's a distortion of the00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000true Bach wait 'til you hear the next one -00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000which is a transmogrification of the00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000same fugue again but on the much talked -00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000and written about Moog synthesizer.00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:45.000And here it comes now -- hello, Hal.00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.000How about that?00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000What you're going to hear now is that00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000same Bach fugue pre-recorded on a tape00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000which was made by this incredible00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000electronic instrument. It can do anything00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000but stand up and take a bow! It can00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000produce almost any kind of variation on00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000pure sound, including some sounds that00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000have never been heard before -- on this00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000earth, at least -- and these sounds can then00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000be dubbed onto tape in any combination00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000from interplanetary noises to a Bach00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000fugue. But there's been so much talk and00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000publicity about this extraordinary00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000machine that I needn't take time to00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000describe it in any further detail. Anyway,00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000what do I know about oscillators and00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000patch panels and all that jazz? The thing00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000about it that really interests us today00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000is that this is the instrument00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000on which has been recorded a very00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000popular album called "Switched-On Bach,"00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000which I'm sure most of you have listened00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000to. Through this record album, the Moog00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000machine here has made a startling00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000contribution to the new Bach rage. Now00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000the -- what shall I say -- bizarre version of00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000the Bach fugue it's about to play for us00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000was prepared by Mr. Walter Sear. Now, are00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000you ready? Prepare decompression00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000chambers, force field operative, all00:17:19.000 --> 00:18:59.000systems go, and... blast off!00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000I think we've just about had that fugue,00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000don't you? So let's clear the air as soon00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000as we clear the stage by going to00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000another famous Bach piece, in a whole00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000different key. This time, it's for00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000unaccompanied violin solo -- that is, in 00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000Bach original version's -- and after it00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000you're going to hear a00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000transmogrification of it that may make00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000your hair stand on end. But first, let's00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000hear a little bit of the original -- the00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000Praeludium from Bach's E-major Partita00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000played by our own distinguished concert00:21:28.000 --> 00:22:12.000master, David Nadien.00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000I hate to stop that beautiful playing, but00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000that's enough to give you some idea of00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000the piece, which goes on in much the same00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000way for about four minutes.00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000Now: for the transmogrification, along00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000comes one of our best-known and most00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000talented composers, Lukas Foss, who for00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000some years has been experimenting with00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000various new wrinkles in the world of the00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000so-called avant-garde, the way-out00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000fringes of contemporary music. Mr. Foss,00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000was also a fine conductor, has taken this00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000well-loved and world-famous piece of00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000violin music, and has made -- not a00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000transcription at all like Stokowoski --00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000but a whole new modern piece of his own,00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000in which, astonishingly enough, every note00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000comes from the Bach piece. But the way he00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000puts these notes together is something00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000else, as you'll hear in a moment. Foss00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000calls his piece Phorion -- a Greek word00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000meaning "stolen goods" -- thereby emphasizing00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000the fact that all the notes he uses are00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000stolen, or borrowed, from Bach. And he has00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000subjected these notes to a highly00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000unusual treatment, which I'll try to00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000explain to you as briefly as I can. First00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000of all, each member of the orchestra has00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000two sets of music in front of him: one a00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000sheet containing Bach's original, and the00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000other a complicated set of instructions.00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000These instructions describe a series of00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000musical events, the length of each event00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000being more or less left up to the whim00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000of the conductor. Also left to the00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000conductor's whim are the entrances and00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000exits of the various instrumental groups00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000in the orchestra -- with this one special00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000added attraction that whenever a group00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000of instruments is queued out by the00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000conductor, they don't stop playing, but00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000continue with their Bach notes, only00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000inaudibly, without being heard. And that may00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000sound impossible, but it's exactly so. For00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000instance, the cellos may be playing along00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000like this:00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000when suddenly the conductor gives them00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000the stop sign:00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000and they continue to finger the notes, but not to bow them,00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000thus producing no sound except the tiny00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000tapping of their fingers on the strings.00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000Listen. You hear? Meanwhile another group00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000has been cued in, let's say the clarinets.00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000Then they are cued out and the cellos00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000are cued back in, blooming suddenly into00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000sound at whatever point they may have00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.999reached during their inaudible music:00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:03.000like this:00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000You see it's a wild idea, but an exciting one, especially when the00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000whole orchestra is doing it together,00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000creating waves of sound rather like00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000ocean waves rolling in unpredictably00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000from any and all directions. But there's00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000much more to this Phorion than that one00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000trick; there are so-called supporting00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000instruments, mostly brass and winds, that00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000pick up occasional bits of the string00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000music and join in, sometimes00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000imitating them, sometimes mocking them.00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000Here's one example:00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000And then more there are three electric00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000instruments -- electric guitar, organ and00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000piano -- who have their own separate00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000instructions, which I won't go into, too00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000complicated. And then there are different00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000percussion groups stationed around the00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000edges of the stage, with the cymbals,00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000gongs, anvils, and whatnot they sometimes00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000support the instruments in front of them,00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000and at other times join in battle with00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000them, making random sounds of knocking,00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000whipping, hammering, or breaking. In fact,00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000the first sound you'll hear, on the00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000opening downbeat, includes the smashing00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000of a soda bottle in a burlap bag. And by00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000the end of the piece, with everyone going00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000at once for all their worth, Bach has00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000been turned into a bloody battlefield of00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000noise. It's certainly not Bach any more, and00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000you may not even think it winds up being00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000music in its usual sense, but whatever it00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000is, it's an intensely personal expression00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000by a dedicated, talented composer who00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000adores Bach as I happen to know. So if he00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000seems to you to be murdering Bach, it may00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000be really that he's expressing something00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000about our century that can be expressed00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000only by committing this kind of violence00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000on the music of the past. This Phorioin00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000can amaze us and amuse us, even in the00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000abbreviated versions we're about to hear,00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000but it can also tell us something00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000awfully important if we listen with our00:27:16.000 --> 00:31:27.000minds as well as our ears. Here goes:00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000So far, in our look at transmogrified00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000Bach,00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000we've spent much more time on the00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000transmogrifications-- than on Bach00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000himself -- which is right, since that's what00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000this program is about. But somewhere00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000along the way we may begin to long for a00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000bit more of the real thing - more than00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000just a four-minute organ fugue and a00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000snatch of a solo violin piece. So now,00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000before our next and final00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000transmogrification (which may turn out to00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000be the wildest one of all) let's hear a00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000good solid hunk of untranslated Bach,00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000namely the opening movement of the Fifth00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000Brandenburg Concerto in D major, which is00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.000scored for a small string orchestra, as00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000you see, with three soloists - violin, flute,00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000and harpsichord. Even this performance is00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000going to be somewhat transmogrified, that00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000is, not exactly as it was heard in Bach's00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000day - since the stringed instruments are00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000played very differently now from the way00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000they were played then, plus the fact that00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000the piano has replaced the harpsichord00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000as the standard keyboard instrument.00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000Besides we're going to shorten it a00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000little bit. The solo parts will be played00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000by David Nadien (who is certainly earning00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000his bread today), by our great solo00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000flutist Julius Baker, and yours truly at00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000the keyboard. So let's give our undivided00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000attention to the glories of Bach's00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000concerto, before we let the New York00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000Rock and Roll Ensemble get their hot00:35:03.000 --> 00:37:38.000hands on it. David, Julie!00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000And now, at last, we turn the stage over00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000to those five mad geniuses who go by the00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000name of the New York Rock and Roll00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000Ensemble. They are five hybrids -- half blue-00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000blood and half Beatle, half conservatory-00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000trained and half trained in the College00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000of Hard Rock. I'm not quite sure what00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000they're going to do with this music we00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000just presented them with the Fifth00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000Brandenburg Concerto and said, take it00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000from there. And wherever they take it,00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000whether you approve or not, one thing is00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000sure: it's going to be fun. And who knows:00:44:54.000 --> 00:46:10.000it may even be beautiful.00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000<v ANNOUNCER>From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000at the second of this season's New York00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000Philharmonic Young People's Concerts00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000under the musical direction of Leonard00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000Bernstein has presented "Bach00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000Transmogrified." The Little Fugue in G-minor was00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000played on the organ by Michael Korn, by00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000the orchestra and Leopold Stokowski, and00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000by the Moog synthesizer, on a tape00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000prepared by Walter Sear. Also heard on00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000today's program was Lukas Foss for Ian00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000and a part of a fifth Brandenburg00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000Concerto with David Nadien, violinist,00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000Julius Baker, flutist, and Mr.00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000Bernstein at the piano. A Rock Variation00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000and Fantasy was performed by the New00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000York Rock and Roll Ensemble. The next00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000program in this series will be seen in00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000eight weeks on May 25th when Mr.00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000Bernstein's subject will be the Symphony00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000Fantastique by Hector Berlioz. This00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000program was recorded in Philharmonic00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000Hall and was produced and directed by00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:38.000Roger England.00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000This special program has been brought to00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000you by Polaroid corporation
