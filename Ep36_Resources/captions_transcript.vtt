Imagine, it's00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000been a whole decade we've been playing00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000and talking about music for you. And I00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000don't know how much you've actually00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000learned, but I like to think we must be00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000doing something right, because -- well00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000because it's our 10th season. And to add00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000to the festivities, this is also the00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000first season in which all our programs00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000will be seen on television in color,00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000which is why I've got this modishly00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000colorful tie on. And that brings us to00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.999our subject: what is a mode? Well, for one00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000thing, musical modes have nothing to do00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000with neckties, or dresses, or even with00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000fashions of a musical kind. Modes are00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000simply scales - though not perhaps those00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000very scales you practice on your piano.00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000They are other special scales; and I00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000wouldn't have dreamed of bothering you00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000with them, except for an incident that00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000happened a few months ago. My 14-year old00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000daughter Jamie happened to ask me one00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000day why a certain Beatles song had such00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000funny harmony; she couldn't seem to find00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000the right chords for it on her guitar.00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000And I began to explain her that the song00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000was modal - that is, it was based on what00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000is called a mode and I went on to show00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000her the chords that came from that mode--00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000and she got so excited she wanted to00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000know more and more about it, so finally00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000she said: "What, why not tell all this on00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000Young People's program? Nobody ever heard00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000of modes!" Well, I thought Jamie is just a00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000natural music-lover with the usual00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000weekly piano lesson, and if she finds00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000this material fascinating, why shouldn't00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000you? So here goes, and you can blame it00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000all on Jamie. O.K. We already know that a00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000mode is a scale. But first of all, what is00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000a scale? I'm sure you know; but maybe00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000you've never tried to put it into words.00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000Well a scale is simply a way of dividing00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000up the distance between any note and the00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000same note repeated an octave higher. Now00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000the most famous and often used division00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000of this octave range in our Western00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000music00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000is what we call the major scale. I guess00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000you all know that one. And the other00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000famous one is the minor scale. I guess00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000you know that too. Now what's the00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000difference between the major and the00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000minor? Many people think the only00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000difference is that major scales sound00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000happy and minor ones sounds sad. Well,00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000that's sometimes true, but not always. The00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000real difference is in the arrangement of00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.999the intervals - you remember how deeply we00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.000dug into intervals last season? And you00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000remember we found that the smallest00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000interval- that is, the distance from any00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000note to its nearest neighbor - is called a00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000half-tone so from C to C sharp is a step00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000of a half-tone. And from C sharp to D is00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000again a half-tone. So it would stand to00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000reason that from C straight to D is a00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000whole tone - since two halves make a whole.00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000Get it? Fine. Now this entire C-major00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000scale is nothing but a series of whole00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000tones and half-tones arranged in a00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000special order: first, two whole tones, one00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000two, then a half tone, and three whole00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000tones.00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000And then a half tone. That's a major scale.00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000And the minor scale is almost the same00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000arrangement of intervals: the main00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000difference being in the third note of00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000the scale which in the minor is a half00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.999tone lower so that the minor scale00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.000sounds like this.00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000And it doesn't matter whether you start00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000on C or an E flat or on Q sharp: you00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000can always get a major or a minor00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000scale by following the proper00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000arrangement of intervals. For instance,00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000here's a major scale beginning on00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000f-sharp and that's called f-sharp major.00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000Here's f-sharp minor.00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000And here's a major scale beginning on B00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000flat.00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000That's called B flat major and here's B00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000flat minor and so it goes but the00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000important thing to remember is that00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000those two kinds of scales major and00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000minor are modes major mode and minor00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000mode, two modes out of a much larger00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000number of possible ones.00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000Now before I tell you anything else00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000about modes, we're going to play you a00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000short but marvelous piece, by the great00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000French composer Debussy. This piece is00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000completely based on modes that are00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000neither major nor minor. This brilliant00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000piece, which is called Festivals, or, in00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000French, Fetes, uses all kinds of other modes00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000which, of course, you won't know about yet;00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000you'll just be hearing beautiful sounds00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000that will seem a bit strange and ear-00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000tickling. But we're going to play it00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000again later, at the end of this program,00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000and I'm sure that by then you'll be able00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000to recognize most of the peculiar things00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000that are going on. So, for the moment just00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000enjoy it and imagine a splendid00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000night-time celebration, with many-colored00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000lights and lanterns everywhere, at00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000gorgeous fireworks in the sky, and00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000everyone dancing in costumes, of light, of00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000long ago. And suddenly in the middle of00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000the piece, the dance music breaks off, and00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000we faintly hear a procession in the far00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000distance. This march-like music comes00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000nearer and nearer, and when it finally00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000arrives in all its glory, the dance-music00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000and the March music are heard together00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000in an exciting blend of tumultuous00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000sounds. And finally the end of the piece00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000it grows late, the crowds thin out-as--00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000does the music and it all ends in a00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000whisper, with an echo or two of the00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000night's festivities hanging in the air.00:07:09.000 --> 00:11:36.000Here is Debussy's Fetes.00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000How about that for an exciting piece? I00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000find it positively goose-fleshy. And a00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000lot of the excitement in it comes from00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000the fact that it uses those strange00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000scales, or modes, which are neither major00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000nor minor. For instance, right at the00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000beginning, appears that swirling dance00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000tune which sounds at first as though00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000it's in the usual minor mode. In fact, the00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000first five notes of it are exactly the00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000first five notes of the minor scale, but00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000then comes the twist. These notes don't00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000belong to any minor scale that we know.00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000And what scale is this? Answer: it's the00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000scale of the Dorian mode. Now don't let00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000that throw you: keep calm, sit back and00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000let's quietly find out just what this00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.999Dorian mode is, and why it sounds so00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:03.000special. The word Dorian obviously comes00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000from the Greek: and in fact as well as00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000all the other modes we're about to00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000discover it does come originally from00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000the music of ancient Greece. We don't00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000know too much about that old Greek music:00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000what we do know is that the Greek modes00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000eventually made their way to Rome, and00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000were taken up by the Roman Catholic00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000Church during the Middle Ages in a00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000somewhat different form. But the church00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000kept the old Greek names for the modes:00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian,00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000Aeolian, Locrian, and Ionian. Now there's00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000a mouthful for you, I know, but they're00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000much easier to understand then their00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000names are to pronounce. And they are00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000still used today in Catholic churches00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000all over the world, in those beautiful00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000chants called plain-song. Here's a tiny00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:08.000example of plain song, in the Dorian mode:00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000Isn't that beautiful?00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000And I'm I bet you didn't know they could00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000sing, too? Did you? You, you've just00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000witnessed the debut of a great new glee00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000club. Anyway, that music is in the Dorian00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000mode, and uses exactly the same scale, the00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000same arrangement of intervals, as Debussy used00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000in his Fetes. But what is this scale? Well00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000that's easy. To find the Dorian mode on00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000your piano, all you have to do is start00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000on the note D and play only white notes00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000all the way up to the next D.00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000And you've got it. Simple. And that's true00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000of all the other Church modes -- as well by00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000the way -- they're all to be found by00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000starting on a given white note and00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000making a scale up using white notes only.00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000Isn't that lucky? And we're particularly00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000lucky with the Dorian mode, because it00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000starts on D, and D is the first letter of00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000the word Dorian! So you have no excuse00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000for forgetting how to find this mode: on00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000your piano, Dorian,00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000Capital D, note D, white notes all the way00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000up and voila. 00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000Now here's another piece in the Dorian00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000mode -- I wonder if you know this one: Every00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000time I think that I'm the only one is00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000lonely someone calls on me and every00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000now and then I spend my time in00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000rhyme and verse and curse those faults and then along00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:52.000comes Mary, along,00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000Along comes Mary, in the ancient and00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000honorable Dorian mode--the same mode we00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000just heard in Debussy and in the plain-00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000chant. Now who'd have thunk it? What is00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000that old Greek mode doing in today's pop00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000music? Well I'll tell you. From about the00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000time of Bach until the beginning of our00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000own century -- roughly 200 years our00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000western music has been based almost00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000exclusively on only two modes -- the major00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000and the minor. I can't go into the why's00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000and wherefore's of it now, but it's true.00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000And since most of the music we hear in00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000concerts today was written during that00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000200 year period, we get to think that00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000major and minor modes are all there are.00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000But the history music is much longer00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000than a mere 200 years. There was an awful00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000lot of music sung and played before Bach,00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000using all kinds of other modes. And in00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000the music of our own century, when00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000composers have gotten tired of being00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000stuck with major and minor all the time,00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000there's been a big revival of those old00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000pre-Bach modes. And that's why Debussy00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000used them so much and other modern00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000composers like Hindemith and Stravinsky,00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000and almost all the young song writers of00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000today's exciting pop music scene. The00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000modes have provided them with a fresh00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000sound, a relief from the old, overused00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000major and minor.00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000For instance, if that swinging opening of00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000Along Comes Mary had been written in the00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000usual everyday minor mode it would sound00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000like this.00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000Sort of square, isn't it? Ordinary. But00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000this -- this has a kick in it, and that kick00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000is Dorian. You can see that this Dorian00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000mode is almost like an ordinary minor00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000mode, but not quite. And that not quite is00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000what makes the difference and that00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000difference gives the music a certain00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000ancient, primitive, oriental feeling.00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000That's why the plain-chant we heard00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000before is so stirring, so ancient as to00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000seem timeless. And that's why the tune00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.999in Debussy's Fetes seems so exotic, and00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:02.000of another age. And that's why Along00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000Comes Mary sounds so primitive, and earthy.00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000Now, by way of contrast listen to this00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000opening section of Sibelius Sixth00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000Symphony, which is also in the Dorian00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000mode, and see if you can feel again that00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000same timeless, brooding, ancient, far-off00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000quality, only this time coming from the00:19:22.000 --> 00:20:09.000remote, lonely forests of Finland:00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000You see what I mean by the special00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000feeling of the Dorian mode? Are you00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000beginning to get the sound of it in your00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000ears? Well, let's get technical just for a00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000minute,00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000and find out exactly what it is that00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000gives us this feeling. As we know, this00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000Dorian mode is practically like the00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000usual minor mode with one very big00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000difference in the minor mode the seventh00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000note.00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000It's called the "leading tone," because it00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000leads us home to the key note, or tonic00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000which is D. And that leading tone leads00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000us to the tonic by the smallest possible00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000interval, namely a half tone. You see, 00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000Amen, it's as though that leading tone00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000were in love with the tonic and we're00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000pulled toward it wants to embrace it. It00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000wants to get there oh it does. But in the00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000Dorian mode where the seventh note is a00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000half tone lower there's a full whole00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000step between it and the tonic. So it just00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000doesn't seem to lead as strongly it's,00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000it's not in love with the tonic, it's00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000friendly enough but it just wants to00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000shake hands. You feel how formal, how00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000strange and modal that sounds? That 00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000Amen the minute we hear that Amen we00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000feel behind it the weight of many00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000centuries, of a different older, more00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000Eastern culture. Bach never wrote an Amen00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000like that, and neither did Beethoven or00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000Brahms. But in our own century gets00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000written all the time.00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000For example, this; Secret Agent Man, secret00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000agent man, well there's no Amen of00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000cours; but musically it's exactly the00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000same idea, you see. Well that's an awful00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000lot about the Dorian mode, which may you00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000never forget as long as you live, starts00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000on D. Right now let's get on to the next00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000one - which starts on E the next note. This00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000is called the Phrygian mode, and again00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000this is terribly easy to find on the00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000piano: you start on E, again you play00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000white notes up to the next E00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000and there's your Phrygian mode.00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000Now this Phrygian mode is very much like00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000the Dorian: in that it is a minor mode00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000and it has that lowered 7th or leading00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000tone. You see again that formal strange00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000modal sound. But it also has something00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000else very unusual: it's the only mode00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000that begins with a step of a half-tone--00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000that is, from the first note, E, to the00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000second note, F, is a mere half step and00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000that gives the music especially sad00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000quality which can be heard in so much00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000Spanish and Hebrew and gypsy music.00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000For instance, you all know the beginning00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000of Liszt's famous second Hungarian00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000Rhapsody -- don't you?00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000You hear that typical sad, gypsy sound?00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000That's the Phrygian mode for you. It's a00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000very oriental-sounding mode, but has also00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000been very much used by Western composers00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000even during that famous 200 year00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000non-modal period, especially when they00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000wanted to create oriental effects. Like00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000this well-known spot in00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade - which, as00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:49.000you know, is wildly oriental:00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000That's about as oriental as you can get.00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000And it's pure Phrygian.00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000That's the Phrygian scale. But the real00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000surprise is to find that even old00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000unoriental Brahms from Germany has used00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000this mode - it's very unusual for him -- in00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000the slow movement of his Fourth symphony.00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000I'm sure you've all heard this solemn00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:35.000and majestic phrase:00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000That's the sound of the Phrygian mode.00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000Courtesy of Mr. Brahms. All right, up we00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000climb now to the next mode, which is00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000called the Lydian. And this one, as you00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000might guess, begins on F, and like all the00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000others, it uses only white notes all the00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000way up the octave.00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000That's the Lydian mode. Now what makes00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000this one different from the other two00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000modes we've already talked about? Two00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000things: first, that it's a major mode -- as00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000you can hear -- it's the first one we've00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000met so far; and second, - well let's see if00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000you can tell me. I'm gonna play you our00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000normal scale of F major and now the00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000Lydian scale starting on F.00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000There's one very peculiar note in that00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000mode -- the only note that's different from00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000the usual F major scale. And I want you00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000to tell me which note is the peculiar00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000one, by clapping your hands the second00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000you hear it. Is that a deal? O.K.00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000First, here's the normal F-major scale00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000and don't clap. Good. Now the Lydian scale;00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000and remember, you're gonna clap when you00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000hear the "wrong" note. O.K. good great,00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000exactly. It's the fourth note of the00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000scale, which is a half tone higher than00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000the normal one. That's normal, right. This00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000is abnormal, good. All right now you've00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000got it out of your system. Now that funny00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000note gives this mode a very sort of00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000comical quality, as if a wrong note were00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000being played on purpose. In fact several00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.00020th century composers have taken00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000advantage of this Lydian mode to get00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000comic effects. For instance, Prokofiev in his00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000music for his funny film "Lieutenant00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.500Kije,""00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.000uses this mode, with its raised fourth,00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:50.000note in this piccolo solo. Could you00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000detect that "wrong note"? If this had been00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000written in the straight major scale, it00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000would sound like this:00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000Right, but no Prokofiev adds his00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000comic touch by using that Lydian raised00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000Fourth: but I don't want you to get the00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000idea that the Lydian mode is only00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000comical. On the contrary, it could be a00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000very serious mode indeed. In fact,00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000Beethoven wrote a long extremely serious00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000movement of a string quartet in this00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000very mode. And of course, it's still used00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000in Roman Catholic plain-chant in church.00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000And again, Sibelius was always a great00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000mode-lover was constantly using the00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000Lydian mode, as in this passage from his00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:45.000Fourth symphony:00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000You hear that Lydian note? Only this time00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000it's not a funny note, but a strange00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000piercing note that seems to come from a00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000far-away place. And that's only natural:00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000because these modes do come from far-away -00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000places like the Middle East, and Eastern00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000European countries like Greece, Bulgaria,00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000Finland, Russia, Poland. In fact, Poland is00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000one of the main breeding-grounds for00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000this Lydian mode. You constantly hear it00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000in Polish folk music and in the works of00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000Poland's greatest composer who was00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000Chopin of course, especially when he was00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000writing Polish type dance pieces, like00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000Polonaises and Mazurkas. Here's a bit00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000from one of his best-known Mazurkas; let's00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:58.000see if you can hear that Lydian sound:00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000It's an odd sound isn't it's so fresh and00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000sharp, like the taste of lemon juice. And00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000it's a very Polish sound. In fact, when00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000the Russian composer Mussorgsky - now00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000follow this - when the Russian composer00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000Mussorgsky was writing the third act of00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000his opera Boris Godunov -- an act which00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000takes place in Poland -- he used this same00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000Polish Lydian mode for his Polonaise,00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000which means "Polish Dance." And we're going00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000to play it for you now -- and listen for00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000that tangy Lydian sound of the tune when00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000you hear it:00:29:36.000 --> 00:32:07.000Here it is with the orchestra playing:00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000Well so far we've had a good look at00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000three important modes - the Dorian, the00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000Phrygian and the Lydian - those white-note00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000scales that started on D, on E, and on F,00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000respectively. Now let's have a quick look00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000at the remaining ones -- starting with the00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000one that begins on G and rises up00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000through the octave on white notes. Now00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000this one is called, don't panic, this one00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000is called the Mixolydian mode; and00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000despite its tongue-twisting name, it's00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000one of the most appealing and popular00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000modes of all. Again, like its neighbor, the00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000Lydian, it's a major mode, as you can hear00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000and, also like the Lydian it has one00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000peculiar note in it, only this time. It's00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000a different peculiar note. See if you can00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000tell which it is. Here's a normal G-major00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000scale. Now here's the Mixolydian scale00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000and perhaps you'd care to clap again00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000when you hear the one odd note, very fine.00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000It's the seventh tone, the leading tone00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000which is half a tone lower than the00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000normal for which you will not clap right,00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:25.000no. This is the normal one, which is00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000higher. This is the abnormal one, right.00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000Now this is the only major mode that has00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000a lowered seventh tone; or lowered leading00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000tone; and believe it or not most of the00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000jazz and Afro-cuban music and00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000rock-and-roll tunes we hear owe their00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000very existence to this old Mixolydian00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000mode. Like this Cuban riff.00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000That's just mixolydian. How do you hear00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000how that lowered seventh note takes that00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000jazz sound. Of course the examples I00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000could give you are endless - but just to00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000take a recent smash hit: My Baby Does the00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000Hanky Panky. Mixolydian. Could you believe00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000it? Or do you remember a really terrific00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000song, a barbaric number, of a few years00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000ago, sung by a group known as the Kinks.00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:31.000It's called "You Really Got Me." Girl you00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000really got me going you got me so I got00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000so I can't sleep at night yeah you really got me now00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000you got me so I don't know what I'm doing00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000yeah you're really do dun. That's00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.000All mixolydian, or,00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000or I wonder if you know that absolutely00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.999charming Beatles tune, called "Norwegian00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:07.000Wood" --00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000You hear that lowered seventh? That's00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000what gives it its charm and that's what00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000makes it mixolydian. They are all00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000Mixolydian. Now again, I don't want to00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000give you the idea that this mode00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000produces only jazz and pop music. It's00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000still to be heard as much in churches as00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000in discotheques. And, in fact, our old00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000friend Debussy, when he wanted to suggest00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000a Cathedral rising out of the sea in00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000that famous piano piece of his, called00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000the Sunken Cathedral, uses this same00:36:37.000 --> 00:37:14.000Mixolydian mode.00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000Isn't that a wonderfully impressive song. And00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000years ago, I don't mean my sound, I mean 00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000Debussy's sound, and years ago when I was00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000writing my first ballet "Fancy Free," I00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000also used this mixolydian mode for one00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000of the dances: since it was a Cuban-style00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000number called a Danzon. I naturally00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000used this mode from beginning to end;00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000so it ought to make a good example. Here00:37:42.000 --> 00:39:25.000it is and I hope you like it00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000And now in the few minutes that remain00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000to us, I would like to pay my brief00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000respects to the three modes we still00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000haven't discussed. We could do this very00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000quickly, as you will see, because the00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000first one, known as the Aeolian mode --00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000which luckily starts on A, A -- Aeolian easy00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000to remember -- is almost like our normal00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000minor scale; using all the white notes; in00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000fact, it is sometimes referred to as the00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000"natural minor" mode and it's one special00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000feature is, again, that lowered leading-00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000tone. Amen.00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000Which makes it so similar to the Dorian00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000and Phrygian modes that we don't even have00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000to discuss it any further. Then the next00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000mode, starting on B is known as the00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000Locrian mode and this one we can really00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000skip, because there's almost no music00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000written in it. See the Locrian mode is00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000strangely unsatisfying, it doesn't seem00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000to be conclusive, mainly because the00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000tonic chord you get from it is terribly00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000unsettled -- see what I mean. So hello and00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000goodbye to the Locrian mode. Now we00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000have been through all the white-note00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000modes, starting on D, E, F, G, A, and B. And at00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000last we come to C, the starting note of00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000our final and most triumphant mode of00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000all, called the Ionian. Now listen carefully:00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000here is C and up we go white notes only00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000to the next C --00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000-- and what have we got? Surprise: the C-00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000major scale: the good old, tried and true00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000C-major of Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms, as,00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000now This C major scale, once known as the00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000Ionian, had simply survived better than00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000all its neighbours the evolution of00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000history and emerged in glory as king of00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000all Western music for 200 years.00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000For instance, this tremendous C major00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:32.000celebration by Beethoven.00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000That, that was the last 30 seconds of00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and there is00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000no doubt that it's in C major00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000Beethoven doesn't leave any doubt about00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000that. He hammers the point home. Well by00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000now you've heard enough about modes, and00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000heard enough examples of them, so that I00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000think you're ready to hear Debussy's Fetes00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000again, and this time really connect with00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000it. Just to refresh your memory: do you00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000recall that opening dancy tune in the00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:12.000Dorian mode? And then a little later on,00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000Debussy switches to the Lydian mode --00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000you remember? The one with the raised00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:25.000fourth note, that Polish one. That's Lydian.00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000Then, a few seconds later, he suddenly in00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000the Mixolydian mode -- you remember that's00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000the jazzy one with, the lowered leading00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000tone? And so in the first half-minute of00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000the piece, Debussy has already used three00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000different modes, none of the major or00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000minor, the Dorian, the Lydian, and the00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000Mixolydian. Then in that famous middle00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000section, when the distant procession00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000begins, we hear it first again in the00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.000Dorian mode:00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000That's Dorian but it immediately00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000switches to Mixolydian.00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000And so it goes, one mode after another00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000throughout the whole piece. Now just00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000before we play it for you, there's one00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000thrilling spot in this piece that I'd00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000like to prepare you for: so you could00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000enjoy it as much as possible and that's00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000the wonderful moment when the march00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000music and the dance music come crashing00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000together. Now the trick is, of course, that00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000they are both in the Dorian mode, so they00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000make perfect mates. This is the dance00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000music:00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000And here is the march music:00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:00.000And here are the two musics together:00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000Isn't that a staggering sound? Now, listen00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000to the entire piece; again and I hope you00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000enjoy it at least twice as much as you00:46:09.000 --> 00:51:50.000did the first time you heard it.00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000<v ANNOUNCER (VO)>From Philharmonic hall in Lincoln Center00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000the first of this season's New York00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000Philharmonic Young People's concerts00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000under the musical direction of Leonard00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:03.000Bernstein has been a program titled "What00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000is a Mode," featured were performances of00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000Fetes from Nocturne by Debussy, Polonaise00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000from Boris Godunov and Mussorgsky,00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000and the Danzon from "Fancy Free" by00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:35.000Leonard Bernstein.00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000This program was recorded in00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000Philharmonic hall and was produced and00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000directed by Roger Englander.
