BERNSTEIN ENTERS
(LIVE - ON CUE)
(And) now here is Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
<v BERNSTEIN>
My dear young friends:	I am happy and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
proud to welcome you to our tenth season 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
of Young People's Concerts. Imagine, it's 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
been a whole decade we've been playing 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and talking about music for you. I 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
don't know how much you've actually 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
learned, but I like to think we must be 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
doing something right, because -- well 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
because it's our tenth season. And to add 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to the festivities, this is also the 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
first season in which all our programs 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
will be seen on television in color. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That's why I've got this wildly 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
colorful tie on. Which brings us to 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.999
our subject: what is a mode? Well, for one 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.000
thing, modes have nothing to do 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
with neckties, or dresses, or even with 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
fashions of a musical kind. Modes are 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
simply scales — though not perhaps those 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
scales you are forced to practice on your piano.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They are rather special scales ;*and I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
wouldn't have dreamed of bothering you 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
with them, except for an incident that 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
happened a few months ago. My 14-year old 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
daughter Jamie happened to ask me one 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
day why a certain Beatles song had such 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
funny harmony; she couldn't seem to find 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the right chords for it on her guitar.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I began to explain to her that the song 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
was modal — that is, based on what 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is called a mode: I went on to show 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
her the chords that come from it--

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and she got so excited she wanted to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
know more and more about it, until finally 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
she saids "Why not tell all this on 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a Young People's Program? Nobody ever heard 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of modes!" Well, I thought, Jamie is just a 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
natural music-lover with the usual 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
weekly piano lesson, and if she finds 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
this material fascinating, why shouldn't 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
you? So here goes, and you can blame it 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
all on Jamie. O.K. We already know that a

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
mode is a scale.* But what, first of all, is 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a scale? I'm sure you know; but maybe 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you've never tried to put it into words.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
A scale is simply a way of dividing 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
up the distance between any note and the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
same note repeated an octave higher 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The most famous and often used division 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of this octave in our Western 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
music 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is what we call the major scale. I guess

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you all know that one. And the other 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
famous one is the minor scale. I guess 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
you know that too. Now what's the 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
difference between the major and the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
minor? Many people think the only 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
difference is that the major scales are 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
happy-sounding, and the minor ones are sad. Well, 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that's sometimes true, but not always. The 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
real difference is in the arrangement of 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.999
the intervals — you remember how deeply we 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.000
dug into intervals last season? And you 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
remember we found that the smallest 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
interval - that is, the shortest distance from one 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
note to its nearest neighbor—is called a 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
half-tone (we called it a "minor second" last year, but never mind that now.) So from C to C# is a step 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of a half-tone. And from C# to D is 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
again a half-tone.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But from C straight to D is a 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
whole tone — 2 halves make a whole. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Get it? Fine. Now this entire C-major 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
scale is just a series of whole 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
tones and half-tones arranged in a 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
special order:* C to D, a whole tone; D to E again a whole tone; 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
E to F, a half-tone (since we've skipped nothing); then 3 whole 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
tones: F to G, G to A, A to B; and finally B to C, a half-tone. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That's the formula for any major scale, whether it begins on C or on Eb or on Q-sharp; 2 whole tones, a half-tone, 3 whole tones, and a half-tone.*

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Now the minor scale is almost the same 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
arrangement of intervals: the main 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
difference being in the third note of 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the scale which in the minor is a half

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.999
-tone lower so that the minor scale

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.000
sounds like this 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And it doesn't matter whether you start 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
on C or on Eb or Q sharp:

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
OR (WITHOUT CUT) - SKIPPED
Again, it doesn't matter what note you
start with:	

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
you can always get a (major or) minor 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
scale by following the proper 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
arrangement of intervals that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
SKIPPED
* a whole-tone, a half-tone, 4 whole-tones,
and a half-tone. But let's not burden
CUT	ourselves with any more formulas: *
the important thing is that those two
kinds of scales, major and minor, are
modes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But they are only two modes out of a 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
much larger number of possible ones.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Now before I tell you anything else 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
about modes, we are going to play you a 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
short but marvelous piece, by the great

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
French composer Debussy, which is 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
completely based on modes that are 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
neither major nor minor. This brilliant 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
piece, which is called Festivals, or, in 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
French, Fetes, uses all kinds of modes 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which, of course, you won't know about yet; 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you'll just be hearing beautiful sounds 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that will seem a bit strange and ear-

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
tickling. But we're goirg; to play it 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000
again later, toward the end of this program, 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and I'm sure that by then you'll be able 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to recognize all the peculiar things that are 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
going on. So, for the moment, just 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
imagine a splendid 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
night-time celebration, with many-colored 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
lights and lanterns everywhere, 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
gorgeous fireworks in the sky, and 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
everyone dancing in costumes of 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
long ago. Suddenly, in the middle of 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the piece, the music breaks off, and 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
a procession is heard in the far 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
distance. This march-like music gets 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
nearer and nearer, and when it 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
arrives in all its glory, the dance-music 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and the march music are heard together 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in an excitirg blend of tumultuous 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
sounds. Finally 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it grows late, the crowds thin-out--as 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
does the music--and it all ends in a 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
whisper, with an echo or two of the 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
night's festivities hanging in the silent air. 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Here is Debussy's Fetes.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
How about that for an exciting piece?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It's positively goose-fleshy. And a 

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
lot of the excitement comes from 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the fact that it uses those strange 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
scales, or modes. 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
For instance, right at the 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
beginning, the driving rhythm 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
SKIPPED
of those bright, shining open fifths way up high 
 
tell us that this music is neither major nor minor. Those empty fifths 
 
contain in them neither the 3rd note of the major scale , 
which would make them into major chords , nor the 3rd note of the minor scale , which would make them minor chords . They're just empty, neutral.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Now, underneath them, appears that first swirling dance-

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
tune which sounds at first like

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
the usual minor mode. In fact,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
the first 5 notes are exactly the

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
first five notes of the minor scale but 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
then comes the twist. Those notes don't

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
belong to any minor scale we know.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
SKIPPED
That  is where it gets peculiar.
But Debussy's tune is shaped just like 
a scale, isn't it? . 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So what scale is it? Answer: It's the 

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
scale of the Dorian mode. Now don't let 

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that throw you: keep calm, sit back and 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
let's quietly find out just what this 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.999
Dorian mode is, and why it sounds so 

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:03.000
special. The word Dorian obviously comes 

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
from the Greek: and in fact the Dorian mode, as well as 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the others we're about to 

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
discover, does come originally 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
from the music of ancient Greece. We don't 

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
know too much about that old Greek music: 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
what we do know is that the Greek modes 

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
eventually made their way to Rome, and 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
were taken up by the Roman Catholic 

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Church during the middle ages in a 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
somewhat different form. But the church 

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
kept the old Greek names for the modes:	

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Aeolian, Locrian, and Ionian. There's 

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
a mouthful for you. But they're 

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
much easier to understand than their 

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
names are to pronounce. They are 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
still used today in certain Catholic churches 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
all over the world, in those beautiful 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
chants called plain-song. Here is a tiny 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:15:08.000
example of plain-song, in the Dorian mode:

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That is music in the Dorian 

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
mode, u exactly the same scale, the 

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
same arrangement of intervals, as Debussy used 

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
in his Fetes. But what is the scale? Ah, 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that's easy. To find the Dorian mode on 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
your piano, all you have to do is to start 

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
on the note D.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and play only white notes all the way up to the next D. 

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and you've got it. Isn't that simple? And that's true

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
of all the other Church modes as well -- 

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
they're all to be found by 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
starting on a given white note and 

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
making a scale u white notes only. 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Isn't that lucky? And we're luckier 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
still with the Dorian mode, because it 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
starts on D, and D is the first letter of

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
the word Dorian! So you have no excuse 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
for forgetting how to find this mode:

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Dorian, 

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Capital letter D, the note D, white notes all the way 

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
up--and there it is.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Now here's another piece in the Dorian 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:30.000
mode -- I wonder if you know it:

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Along comes Mary, in the ancient and 

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
honorable Dorian mode -- the same mode we 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
just heard in Debussy and in the plain-

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
chant. Who'd have thunk it? What is 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that old Greek mode doing in today's pop 

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
music? Well, I'll tell you. From about the 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
time of Bach until the beginning of our 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
own century -- roughly 200 years — our 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
western music has been based almost 

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
exclusively on only two modes -- the major 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and the minor. I can't go into the why's 

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and wherefore's now, but it's true.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And since most of the music we hear in 

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
concerts today was written during that 

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
200 year period, we get to think that 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
major and minor modes are all there are. 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
But the history of music is much longer 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
than a mere 200 years. There was a 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
lot of music sung and played before Bach, 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
u all kinds of other modes. And in

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
the music of our own century, when 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
composers have gotten tired of being 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
stuck with major and minor modes all the time, 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
there has been a big revival of those 

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
old pre-Bach modes. That's why Debussy 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
used them so much, and other modern 

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
composers like Hindemith and Stravinsky, 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and almost all the young song writers of

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
today's exciting pop music.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
The modes have provided them with a fresh 

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
sound, a relief from that old, overused 

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
major and minor. 

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
If that swinging opening of 

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Along Comes Mary had been written in the 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
usual, every-day minor mode, it would sound 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
like this.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Sort of square, isn't it? Ordinary. But 

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
this -- this has a kick in it, and the kick 

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000
is Dorian. You can see that this Dorian

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
mode is almost like our ordinary minor 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
mode, but not quite. And that not quite 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
makes a big difference; and that 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
difference gives the music a certain 

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
ancient, primitive, almost oriental feeling. 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
That's why the plain-chant we heard 

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
before is so stirring, so ancient as to 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
seem timeless. And that's why the tune 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.999
in Debussy's Fetes seems so exotic, and 

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:02.000
of another age. And that's why Along 

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Comes Mary sounds so primitive, and earthy. 

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Now listen to this 

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
opening section of Sibelius' Sixth 

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Symphony, which is also in the Dorian 

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
mode, and see if you feel again that 

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
same timeless, brooding, ancient, far-off 

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
quality, this time coming from the 

00:19:22.000 --> 00:20:09.000
remote, lonely forests of Finland:

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Do you see what I mean by the special 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
feeling of the Dorian mode? 

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Let's get technical for a 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
minute, and find out just what it is that 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
gives us this feeling. As we know, this 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Dorian mode is practically like our 

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
usual minor mode — with one very big

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
differences the 7th 

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
note of the scale 

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
That 7th note is called the "leading tone," because it 

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
is supposed to lead us back to the keynote, or tonic 


00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
which is D. And that leading tone leads

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
us back to the tonic by the smallest interval possible, a half-tone.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
But in the Dorian mode,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
there's a full whole-

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
tone between the leading-tone and the tonic. 

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Do you feel how strange and modal that is? 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
The minute we hear that 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
we feel behind it the weight of many 

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
centuries, of a different, older, more 

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Eastern culture. Bach never wrote an Amen 

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
like that, and neither did Beethoven or 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Brahms. But in our own century it gets 

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000
written all the time. 

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
For example, this;

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
There's no Amen, of 

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
course; but musically it's the 

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
same idea.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.500
SKIPPED
And so is this:
STRINGS (2 bars) &amp; :ELEANOR RIGBY (:20)

00:21:58.500 --> 00:21:59.000
Well, that's an awful 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
lot about the Dorian mode - which, you will 

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
never forget as long as you live, starts 

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
on D. Dorian - D. Now let's get on to the next 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
one - which starts on E - 

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
the Phrygian mode. Again, 

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
this is terribly easy to find on the 

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
piano:	you start on E, again play

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
only white notes up to the next E. 

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and there's your Phrygian mode.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Now this Phrygian mode is very much like 

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
the Dorian:	it is a minor mode 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
and it has that lowered 7th leading 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
tone 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
But it also has something 

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
else very unusual:	it is the only mode

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
that begins with a step of a half-tone--

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
that is, from the first note, E, to the 

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
second, F, is a mere half-step.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
And that gives the mode a specially sad 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
quality which can be heard in so much

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Spanish and Hebrew and gypsy music. 

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
For instance, you all know the beginning 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
of Liszt's 2nd Hungarian 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Rhapsody -- don't you? 

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Do you hear that typical sad, gypsy sound?


00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
That's the Phrygian mode for you. It's a 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
very oriental-sounding one, and has 

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
been much used by Western composers 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
during that famous 200-year 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
period when they 

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
wanted to make Oriental effects. Like 

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
this well-known spot in 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the 3rd movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherezade - which, as 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:49.000
you know, is madly Oriental:

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
That's as Oriental as you can get. 

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And it's pure Phrygian 

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
But the real 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000
surprise is to find that even old 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
German Brahms has used 

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
this mode — very unusual for him -- in 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
the slow movement of his 4th Symphony.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
I'm sure you've all heard this solemn 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:35.000
and majestic phrase:

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:35.000
ORK:	Brahms 4th - 1st 4 bars (:20)

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
That's the sound of the Phrygian mode.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
All right, up we 

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000
climb to the next mode, 

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
called the Lydian. This one, as you 

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
might guess, begins on F, and like the 

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
others, uses only white notes all the 

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
way up the octave 

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
That's the Lydian mode. Now what makes 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
this one different from the other two 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
modes we've already talked about? Two 

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
things: first, that it is a major mode 

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
the first one we've 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
met so far; and second, — well let's see if 

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
you can tell me. I'm going to play you our 

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
normal scale of F major, and now, the

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Lydian scale starting on F. 

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Now there's one very peculiar note in that 

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
mode -- the only note that's different from 

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
the usual F-major scale. And I want you 

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
to tell me which note is the peculiar 

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
one, by clapping the second 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
you hear it. Is that a deal? O.K. 

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
First, here's the normal F-major scale. 


00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Now the Lydian scale; 

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
and remember, you're going to clap when you 

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
hear the "wrong" note.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Right:	it's that 4th note of the 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
scale, which is a half tone higher than

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
normal 

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
And it 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
gives this mode a very funny quality, almost comical, 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
as if a wrong note were 

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
being played on purpose. And many 

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
20th century composers have taken 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
advantage of this Lydian mode to get 

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
comic effects. For instance, Prokofieff, in his 

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
music for the comedy-film "Lieutenant 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:28.500
Kije," 

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.000
uses this mode, with its raised 4th, 

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:50.000
in the very opening, as a piccolo solo: Could you

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
detect that "wrong note"? If this were

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
written in the straight major scale, it 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
would sound like this:	

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
But no:	Prokofieff adds his 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
comic touch by u that Lydian raised 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
4th note: 

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
SKIPPED
And our own American composer, Aaron Copland, has used the same device in his music for a comic scene in the film "Of Mice and Men." 
There's that funny note again (PLAY F#).

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
But I don't want you to think 

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
that the Lydian mode is only 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
comical. On the contrary, it can be a 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
very serious mode indeed. In fact,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Beethoven wrote a whole long very serious 

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
movement of a string quartet in this 

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
mode. And, of course, it's still used 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
in Roman Catholic plain-chant.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And again, Sibelius --always a great 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
mode-lover -- was constantly u the 

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Lydian mode, as in this passage from his 

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:45.000
4th symphony:

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:45.000
ORK: Sibelius - 4th Symph., 2nd mov't, beginning to dbt. 1 before (A). (:13)

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Do you hear that Lydian note? Only this time

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
it's not a funny note, but a strange 

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
piercing note that seems to come from a 

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
far-away place. And that's only natural:

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
These modes do come from far-away — 

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
the Middle-East, and Eastern 

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
European countries like Greece, Bulgaria, 

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Finland, Russia, and Poland. In fact, Poland is 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
one of the main breeding-grounds for 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
this Lydian mode. You constantly hear it 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
in the works of Chopin, Poland's greatest composer, 

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
especially when he was 

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000
writing Polish nationalistic dance pieces, like 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Polonaises and Mazurkas. Here's a bit 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
from one of his best-known Mazurkas; and 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:58.000
see if you can hear that Lydian sound:

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
It's an odd sound, isn't it? So fresh and

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
sharp, like the taste of lemon-juice. And 

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
it's a very Polish sound. In fact, when 

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
the Russian composer Mussorgsky - now 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
follow this - was writing the 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
3rd act of 

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
his great opera Boris Godunov -- an act which 

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
takes place in Poland -- he used this same 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Lydian mode for his Polonaise, 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
which means "Polish dance." We're going 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
to play it for you now -- and listen for 

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
that tangy Lydian sound."

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
So far we have had a good look at 

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
three important modes - the Dorian, the 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Phrygian and the Lydian — those white-note 

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
scales that start on D, E, &amp; F, 

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
respectively. Now let's have a quick look 

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
at the remaining ones -- starting with the 

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
mode that begins on G and rises up

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
through the octave on the white notes 

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
This one is called (now don't panic!) — 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
the Mixolydian mode; and 

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
despite its tongue-twisting name, it's 

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
one of the most appealing and popular 

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
modes of all. Again, like its neighbor, the 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Lydian, it's a major mode, as you can hear 

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
and, like the Lydian it has one 

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
peculiar note in it, and only one - only a different one this time. 

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
See if you can 

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
tell which it is. Here is a normal G-major 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
scale. Now here is the Mixolydian scale;

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
and I dare you to clap 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:08.000
when you hear the one odd note. 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Right: it's the 7th tone, the leading tone, 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
which is half a tone lower than 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
normal 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
This is the only major mode that has 

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
a lowered leadirg tone; 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
and believe it or not, most of the 

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
jazz and Afro-Cuban music and 

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
rock-n-roll tunes we hear owe their 

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
existence to this old Mixolydian 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
mode. 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Do you hear how that lowered 7th tone 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
makes a jazz sound?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Of course the examples I 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
could give you are endless — but just to 

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
take a recent smash hit:

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Mixolydian. 

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Or do you remember a terrific, 

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
barbaric song a few years 

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
ago, by The Kinks? --

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:53.000
Pure Mixolydian. 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Or, take that charming Beatles tune, "Norwegian 

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:07.000
Wood" --

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
You hear that lowered 7th note? 

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
That makes it Mixolydian.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
They're all 

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Mixolydian. Now again, I don't want to 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
give you the idea that this mode 

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000
produces only jazz. It's 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
still to be heard in churches as well as 

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
in discotheques. And, in fact, our old 

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
friend Debussy, when he wanted to suggest

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000
a Cathedral risirg out of the sea (in 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
his piano piece, The Sunken Cathedral) used this same 

00:36:37.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Mixolydian mode.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Isn't that an impressive sound.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And years ago, when I was 

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
writing my first ballet "Fancy Free," I 

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
too used this mode for one 

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
of the dances: and since it was a Cuban-style 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
dance called a danzon. I naturally 

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
used this Mixolydian mode from beginning to end; 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
so it ought to make a good example. Here 

00:37:42.000 --> 00:39:25.000
it is, and I hope you like it.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
In the few minutes that remain 

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
to us, I would like to pay my brief 

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
respects to the three modes we still 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
haven't discussed. We can do this very 

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
quickly, as you will see, because the 

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
first one, known as the Aeolian mode -- 

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
which luckily starts on A, making it easy 

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
to remember -- is almost like our normal 

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
minor scale; 

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
in fact, it is sometimes referred to as the 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
"natural minor" mode. Its one special 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
feature is, again, that lowered leading-tone 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
which makes it so similar to the Dorian 

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
and Phrygian modes that we don't even have 

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
to discuss it. Then, the next 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
mode, starting on B, is known as the 

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Locrian and this we can really

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
skip, because there is almost no music 

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
written in it. The Locrian mode is 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
strangely unsatisfying, 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
mainly because the 

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
tonic chord you get from it is terribly 

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
unsettled and inconclusive --see what I mean? So hello and 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
goodbye to the Locrian mode. Now we 

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
have been through all the white-note 

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
modes, starting on D, E, F, G, A, &amp; B. And at 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
last we come to C 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
the starting note of our final and most triumphant mode, 

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
called the Ionian. Listen carefully now:

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
here is C, and up we go, white notes only,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
to the next C 

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
-- and what have we got? Surprise:	The C-

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
major scale! The good old, tried and true 

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
C-major of Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and company.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
This major mode, once known as the 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Ionian, has simply survived the evolutionary process better than 

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
all its neighbors 

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
and emerged in glory as king of 

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
all Western music for 200 years.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
And so, to celebrate the king of all the modes, the major scale, 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
SKIPPED
we are going to play the final minute - the Coda - of the greatest movement to C-major ever built -- Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Here, at last, you won't have to worry about raised 4ths and lowered leading-tones; you can temporarily say goodbye to the Beatles, the Kinks, and even Debussy, and just drink up the majesty and strength of this tremendous C-major festival by-Beethoven."

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Well, by now you've heard enough about modes, and 

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
heard enough examples of them, so that I 

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
think you're ready to hear Debussy's "Festivals" 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.000
again, and this time really connect with 

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
it. But just to refresh your memory: do you

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
recall that opening dancy tune in the 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Dorian mode?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Then, a little later on, 

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Debussy switches to the Lydian mode -- 

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
do you remember? The one with the raised 

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:25.000
4th note, the Polish one? That's Lydian.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Then, a few seconds later, he's suddenly in 

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
the Mixolydian mode -- remember? 

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
The one with the lowered leading tone, the jazzy one?

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:38.000
So, in the first half-minute of 

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
the piece, Debussy has already used three 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
different modes, 

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Dorian, Lydian, and 

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Mixolydian. Then, in that famous middle 

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
section, when the distant procession 

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
begins, we hear it again in the Dorian:

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000
and then it quickly switches to Mixolydian:

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And so it goes, one mode after the other; 

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
including a few I haven't told you about. 

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
But there is one thrilling place in this 

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
piece you should be prepared for:	

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
that wonderful moment when the procession-

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
music and the dance music come 

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
together. The trick is, of course, that 

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
they're both in the Dorian mode, and so they 

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
make perfect mates. Here is the dance

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.000
-music:

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:48.000
And here is the march-music:

00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:00.000
And here are the two musics together:

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Isn't that a staggering sound? Now, listen 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
to the entire piece; and I hope you 

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
enjoy it at least twice as much as 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
the first time you heard it. 

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.000
SKIPPED
You ought to, you know, since you are now Masters of the Modes.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
