So today00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000we're going to make up for lost time and00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000talk about the meat and potatoes of00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000music, the main course, which is melody.00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000Now, to some people music and melody are00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000the same thing, it's the whole meal so to00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000speak when you think of music you think00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000of melody right away. And they're right00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000in a way because what is music anyway,00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000except sounds that change and move along00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000in time and that's practically a00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000definition of melody too, a series of00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000notes that move along in time, one after00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000another. Well if that's true then it's00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000almost impossible to write music that00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000doesn't have melody in it. I mean, if a00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000melody is simply one note coming after00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000another,00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000how can a composer avoid writing00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000melodies if he just writes notes? He must00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000write melodies all the time. For example,00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000he writes one note then he writes00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000another, well that's already a sort of00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000melody. It's a two note melody, sort of.00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000Then we add another not, well it's00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000already a little more melodious, isn't it?00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000But if he then adds a few more,00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000oh we got Mendelssohn's Wedding March.00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000See how simple it is where there's00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000music there's melody. Can't have00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000one without the other. Well then why do00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000so many people complain about music that00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000has no melody? Some people say they don't00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000like Bach fugues because they don't find00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000them melodic and others say the same00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000thing about Wagner operas and others00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000about modern music, and others about jazz.00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000What do you suppose they mean when they00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000say it's not melodic. What are they00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000talking about. Isn't any string of notes00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000a melody? No I think the answer is in00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000the fact that melody can be a lot of00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000different things: it can be a tune or can00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000be a theme or a motive or a long melodic00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000line or a bass line or an inner voice --00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000all those things: and the minute we00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000understand the difference among all00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000those kinds of melody, then I think we'll00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000be able to understand the whole problem.00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000You see, people usually think of melody00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000as a tune, something you can go out00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000whistling, it's easy to remember that00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000sticks in your mind. What's more, a tune00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000almost never goes out of the range of00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000the normal human singing voice that is00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000too high or too low, nor should a tune00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000have phrases that last longer than the00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000normal breath and sing them. After all,00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000melody is the singing side of music just00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000as rhythm is the dancing side. But the00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000most important thing about a tune is00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000usually that it's complete in itself. It00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000seems to have a beginning a middle and00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000an end,00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000and it leaves you feeling satisfied -- in00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000other words it's a song like Gershwin's00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000Summertime or Schubert's Serenade or your00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000favorite Elvis Presley number. But in00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000symphonic music, which is what we're00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000mostly concerned with here, tunes aren't00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000exactly in order because since they're00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000complete in themselves, tunes don't cry00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000out for further development. And as I00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000hope you remember from former programs00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000of ours development is the main thing in00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000symphonic music. The growing of a melodic00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000seed into a big symphonic tree. So that00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000seed mustn't be a complete tune, but00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000rather a melody that leads something00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000still to be said to be developed,00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000and that kind of melody is called a00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000theme. Well, that's already a problem for00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000those people who are always expecting00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000music to consist of full blown tunes so00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000they naturally find these incomplete00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000themes less melodic, let's say. I suppose00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000then they should complain about the00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000famous four note theme that opens00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000Beethoven's Fifth Symphony:00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000that's hardly melodic at all. Or about00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000this theme from his Seventh Symphony,00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000which is mostly harping on the same note.00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000But both of those themes are kind of00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000melodies even though they're not tunes.00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000That's the important thing to remember00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000and not tunes but they're themes. Now of00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000course there are symphonic themes that00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.999are much more melodious than those. Only00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.000think of the Tchaikovsky's sixth00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:13.000Symphony for example.00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000Now that theme is practically a whole00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000tune in itself. What is it about that big,00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000tuneful theme that makes it so00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000attractive and beloved all over the00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000world, besides the fact that Tchaikovsky00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000was a melodic genius? Well the answer is00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000repetition -- either exact repetition or a00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000slightly altered repetition within the00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000theme itself. It's that repetition that00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000makes the melody stick in your mind, and00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000it's the melodies that stick in your00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000mind that are likely to please you the00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000most. Popular songwriters know this and00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000that's why they repeat their phrases so00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000often just think of that big song hit00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000Mack the Knife ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000ba ba ba, repeating over and over. Well00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000the same technique works just as well in00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000symphonic music. For instance, let's just00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000see how Tchaikovsky went about building00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000up that lovely theme we just heard by00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000simply repeating his ideas in a certain00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000arranged order -- what I like to call the00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000one-two-three method. In fact so many00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000famous themes are formed by exactly this00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000method that I think you ought to know00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000about it. Here's how it works: first of00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000all, there's a short idea or a phrase00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000That's number one.00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000Now second the same phrase is repeated00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.000but with a small variation,00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000that's the second part, almost the same00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000as the first, and the third, the tune00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000takes off in a flight of inspiration.00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000and so on. That's the one-two-three00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000method. It's like a three-stage rocket or00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000like the countdown in a race on your00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000mark, get set, go!00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000Or in target practice: ready, aim, fire!00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000Or in a movie studio: lights, camera,00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000action!00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000It's always the same, one, two, and then00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000three! There are so many examples of this00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000melodic technique I almost don't know00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000where to begin, but let's take for one00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000example our good old standby Beethoven's00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000Fifth here, one on your mark;00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:28.000two get set; three, go!00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000one, two, three. Or do you know that00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000haunting team theme in the Cesar Franck00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000Symphony? It's the same thing. First,00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000there's a phrase;00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000then repeats the phrase with a slight00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000change, a rising intensity and then comes00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000the relaxed conclusion.00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000Or the same thing is true in Mozart's00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:14.000Haffner Symphony, it goes: ready, fire, and00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000so on. There are millions of them,00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000examples of this one two three design;00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000and don't forget at the heart of the00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000matter is repetition: two is always a00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000repeat of one. And three is the take-off.00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000Well now that we know a couple of the00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000secrets that make music sound melodic,00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000let's start looking for some of the00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000reasons why people find certain kinds of00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000music unmelodic. We've already discovered00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000that what appeals most to people as00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000melody is a fully spun out tune right,00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000and that when they get instead an00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000incomplete tune or a theme they begin to00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000have trouble. So you can imagine that00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000when they hear music made out of00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000melodies that are even shorter than00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000themes, they have even more trouble. For00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000example, that famous opening of00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000Beethoven's Fifth again papa papa that's00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000so short it's not really even a theme,00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000but what is called a motive. Now a motive,00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000can be as little as two notes or three00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000or four -- a bear melodic seed -- the raw00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000material out of which much longer00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000melodic lines are made. Now you remember00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000how I said that certain people find Wagner's00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000operas unmelodic? This is why: because00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000Wagner usually constructed those huge00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000operas of years out of tiny little00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000motives, instead of writing regular tunes00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000such as the Italian opera composers used.00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000But how wrong they are to say Wagner00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000doesn't write melody!00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000He writes nothing but melody, only it's00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000melody that's made out of motives. Let me00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000show you how. You've all heard a Wagner's00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000great opera Tristan & Isolde, and I'm00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000sure you've heard the prelude. Now this00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000Prelude begins with a four note motive,00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000like this.00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000And immediately after comes another00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000motive, also of four notes. Now the00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000exciting thing is the way Wagner puts00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000these two motives together: he makes the00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000second motive begins smack on the end of00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000the first one, so that the last note of00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000one and the first note of the other are00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000joined, locked together, locking the two00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.000motives securely like this. Now he adds00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000some marvelous harmony underneath and00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000this is what you get, the beginning of00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000Tristan and Isolde:00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000Now that's already much more than a00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000motive or even of two motives, it's00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000become what's called a phrase, just as a00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000series of words in language becomes a00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000phrase and Wagner, by using this method00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000of joining motives together and making00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000phrases out of them, and then sentences00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000out of the phrases and then paragraphs00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000out of the sentences, finally turns out a00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000whole story, a prelude to Tristan that is00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000a miracle of continuous melody without00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000end seemingly, even though there isn't a00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000tune anywhere in it! Do you begin to see00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000what I mean by understanding melody in a00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000different way? If you think you don't00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000just listen to a couple of minutes of00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000this famous Prelude now, and I'm sure00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000you'll be surprised to find that you do00:13:28.000 --> 00:15:18.000understand it very well.00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000And on it goes,00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000one long passionate melody for almost00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000ten minutes. And that sure is a lot of00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000melody for a composer who's supposed to00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000be unmelodic. But you see his melody grew00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000out of little scraps, those motives we00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000heard at the beginning and that's where00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000people make the mistake of thinking00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000there's no melody in Wagner. Of course,00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000what makes it even more difficult for00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000people to recognize the melody is that00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000frightening word counterpoint, which00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000means as you know more than one melody00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000going on at the same time, that really00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000gets in people's way because, but it00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000shouldn't because after all the more00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000melody the better and counterpoint can00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000be terribly exciting. For example, in this00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000same Tristan Prelude much later on00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000Wagner builds a hair-raising climax by00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000using counterpoint in this way the00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000strings are pouring out their melody,00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:58.000climbing higher and higher like this.00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000And while that frenzy is going on the00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000horns and cellos down lower are00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000screaming out the first four-note motive00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:20.000we heard, over and over like this. And00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000that's not all at the same time the00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000trumpet joins in with all his force00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000right in the middle between the other00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000two melodies, singing the second four00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000note motive again and again like this.00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000Now, do you think all that's too much00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000melody for a human ear to catch all at00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000once well just listen to it all together00:18:46.000 --> 00:19:16.000and I'll bet you hear at all every note.00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000Boy what a climax that is, one of the00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000most thrilling ever composed and yet00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000it's counterpoint, that frightening word00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000that makes some people afraid to listen00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000to Bach fugues or to Wagner operas but00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000don't you ever be scared of counterpoint.00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000Counterpoint is not an absence of melody;00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000it's an abundance of melody. It doesn't00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000erase melody it multiplies it. Well now00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000that's a lot of hard stuff we've been00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000discussing so far. And so to make it00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000clearer and easier for you we're going00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000to play you a whole movement from a00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000Mozart Symphony, the first movement of00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000his great G minor symphony, which will00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.999illustrate everything we've been talking00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.000about so far. I'm sure you all know the00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000beautiful theme that opens this movement.00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000It's a perfect example of that00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000one-two-three method we learned about00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000before first there's a phras,e00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000and then he repeats the same phrase00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000slightly lower, and then third the00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000takeoff.00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000Now certainly nobody will quarrel with that00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000as being unmelodic. It has such a00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000beautiful shape, and arch. The way it goes00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000up and down. Di-da-dum Di-da-dum di-da-darum00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000Di-da-dum Di-da-dum di-da-dum. And that's00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000another important feature of good melody,00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000its shape, the curve it makes as it rises00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000with tension and then sinks down in00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000relaxation and this Mozart theme is a00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000perfectly shaped melody, I'm sure you'll00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000all agree with that. But in the course of00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000the movement, as the theme is being00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000developed, you'll find all kinds of00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000places that might be called unmelodic, or00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000at least less melodic. But you're ready00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000now to understand that even those places00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000are melodic, as much as the opening theme00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000is -- if you just listen to them correctly.00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000For instance, you'll notice that the very00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000first two notes of the main theme,, Those00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000two notes form a little motive by00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000themselves, just as in Wagner. Remember00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000that motive because it's used all00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000through the movement. Now about half way00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000along in this movement, one part of the00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000orchestra is playing with this motive00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000this way:00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000while the strings are playing in00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000counterpoint, the same to note motive00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000only stretched out in long notes. You see00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000So that together it all makes this00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000wonderful sound.00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000And that's all made out of those first00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000two little notes that I played for you00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000before. So you see it's all pure melody,00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000even the development parts. And the same00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000is true of this seemingly unmelodic00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000section: Now some people would say that00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000passage lacks melody; but the theme is00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000right there, only it's down in the bass00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000instruments: Here while on top here00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000there's exciting counterpoint going on00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000the way it goes in a Bach fugue. You see,00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000you just have to learn to listen for00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.999melody in the depths of music, as well as00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:00.000on top.00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000Tunes aren't always on top. And if you do00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000listen that way how different that same00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000passage will sound, just try and00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000listen again. You see, and what's even00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000harder to hear is melody that's neither00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000on top nor on the bottom but in the00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000middle, sort of like the middle of a00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000sandwich. Now here's one place in the00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000movement you should be on the lookout00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000for, where again that little two note00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000motive is being developed on top over00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:42.000motionless notes on the bottom like this.00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000Now in the middle there are two00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000clarinets having their say about the00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000motive like this:00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000And they're so sweet and tender that it00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000would be a shame if you missed them,00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000would be like having two pieces of dry00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000bread with nothing in them. So now listen00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000to the whole sandwich, top, slice, bottom00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:17.000slice, and clarinet filling.00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000So all that is melody - made out of00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000those first two little notes of the00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000theme. Well, I think you're ready now to00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000hear this great movement by Mozart and00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000listen to it as melody, all of it, from00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000start to finish,00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000not just the themes themselves, but the00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000development of those themes and the00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000motives as well with all their00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000counterpoint. It's all melody every00:24:39.000 --> 00:25:10.000moment.00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000Now the title of this program is "What is00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000a Melody?" Well, what is it? Have we found00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000out yet? Any series of notes we said00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000before, but that's not a very satisfying00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000answer because some series of notes00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000please us and others don't. So I guess00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000the question ought to be: what makes an00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000unmolody? Well, so far we've discussed00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000a few of the reasons why some people00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000find certain kinds of music unmelodic -- like 00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000melodies going against each other, as in00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000counterpoint, or a melody singing away00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000down in the bass, not easily recognized00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000or buried in the middle of a sandwich;00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000which is hard to find; or a melody00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000constructed out of tiny motives, which is00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000not exactly a tune. But the really00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000important reason -- and I think this is00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000what I've been trying to get at all this00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000time -- is the question of what our ears00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000expect -- in other words what we call taste.00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000And that, in turn, depends on what our00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000ears are used to hearing for instance.00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000We've seen today how important00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000repetition is in making a melody easy to00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000latch on to. Okay, but what happens when00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000we hear melodies that don't repeat at00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000all, that just weave on and on, always new?00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000Well, it's true that we usually like them00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000less -- at first. But that doesn't mean00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000they're any less melodic; in fact, the00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000farther away you get from that kind of00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000repetition, like Mack the Knife, the00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000harder the melodies may get to latch on00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000to, but also the more beautiful and00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000nobler they can become. Some of the00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000really greatest melodies ever written00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000are of this kind, non-repeating long00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000lines; only they're not necessarily the00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000ones people go around whistling in the00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000streets.00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000I remember for instance so well the day my00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000piano teacher brought me a new piece to00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000study when I was 14 years old or so,00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000which was Bach Italian concerto. And00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000when I began to read the second movement00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000with its long, ornamental melody line, I00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000simply couldn't understand. it it just00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000seemed to wander around, with no place to00:32:37.000 --> 00:33:09.000go. Do you know it? It goes like this:00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000So it goes on weaving, spinning out that00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000long golden thread, never once repeating00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000itself for almost five minutes.00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000Do you find it wandering and aimless? I00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000find it one of the glories of all music,00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000now today; but I sure didn't think so00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000when I was 14. I was still young enough00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000to think that every melody had to be a00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000repeating tune because that's what my00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000brief musical experience had taught my00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000ears to expect. Now in exactly the same00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000way our tastes change with growing up,00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000and hearing all kinds of different music,00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000so people's tastes change from one00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000period of history to another. The00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000melodies people loved in Beethoven's00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000time would have shocked and startled the00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000people of Bach's time, 100 years earlier,00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000and I'm equally sure that some of00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000today's modern music, which people00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000complain about is ugly and unmelodic will00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000be perfectly charming everyday stuff to00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000the people of tomorrow. We're going to00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000play you an example -- another long,00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000non-repeating melodic line by the great00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000modern German composer Paul Hindemith.00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000Now Hindemith wrote this melody over 3000:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000years ago in a piece called Concert00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000Music for Strings and Brass; and I00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000suppose there are still people who call00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000this unmelodic, even after thirty years. I consider it one of the00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000most moving and beautifully shaped00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000melodies, not only of modern music but of00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000all music; and I have a feeling that00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000you'll agree with me, after all you've00:34:39.000 --> 00:36:55.000learned about melody today, just listen.00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000Well, whether you like that or not00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000that is a great melodic line, four00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000minutes of beautiful curves, arches, peaks00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000and valleys. And full of emotional beauty.00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000And if there are any of you who didn't00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000like it, who found it unmelodic, awkward, or00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000graceless, let me comfort you by saying00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000that those were just the exact words00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000used eighty years ago about another00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000German composer named Brahms. Now these00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000days, when we think of melody, we almost00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000immediately think of the name Brahms; but00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000there was a time when people complained00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000bitterly about his music as being00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000totally lacking in melody. And so, to wind00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000up our program on melody, we're going to00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000play Brahms, and to show you how careful00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000you have to be in deciding what is a00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000melody and what isn't. We're going to00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000play for you the last movement of Brahms'00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000Fourth symphony -- an extraordinary00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000movement for many reasons, but chiefly00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000for the reason that its main theme is00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000nothing but a scale of six notes plus00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000two notes to finish it off. I played five00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000notes, now wait a minute, six notes six. And then00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000two notes to finish it off, which makes00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000eight notes. Eight notes in all, one to00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000a bar, and with harmony they sound like00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000this.00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000Now following those eight bars come00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000thirty variations, each one also eight00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000bars long, and each one containing those00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000same eight simple notes, always in the00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000same key. And that plus a short wind-up00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000at the end is the whole movement. Now00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000that doesn't sound very promising in00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000terms of melody, does it, a scale and a00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000cadence? And yet, what Brahms gives us in00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000this movement is a work of such glowing,00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000fiery melodic beauty that we are left at00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000the end cheering. Now how does he do it?00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000In all the ways we talked about today,00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000counterpoint, motives, repetitions, the00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000theme in the bass the theme in the00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000middle the one-two-three method remember?00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000But I'm not going to explain it any00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000further to you because I think that by00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000this time you're prepared to hear this00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000so-called unmelody and the Magnificent00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000outpouring of melody that it really is.00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000And if you're still wondering what is00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000melody, just listen to this movement, and00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000you'll realize that melody is exactly00:41:15.000 --> 00:43:35.000what a great composer wants it to be.00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center --00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000another New York Philharmonic Young00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000People's Concert under the musical00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000direction of Leonard Bernstein. This00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000concert -- "What is a Melody?" -- featured the00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000music of Wagner, Mozart, Hindemith, and00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000Brahms. The preceding program was00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.000pre-recorded and was produced and00:51:48.000 --> 00:52:00.000directed by Roger Englander.
