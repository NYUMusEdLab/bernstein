00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
home of the world's greatest musical events, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the Shell Oil Company brings you the

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
New York 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Philharmonic YOUNG PEOPLE'S CONCERTS 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
under the musical direction of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Leonard Bernstein.  

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
<v BERNSTEIN> My dear young friends: On our last 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
program we devoted so much time to 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
introducing our new Philharmonic Hall to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you, and to introducing you to the new 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
science of acoustics, that we didn't get 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to talk very much about music. So this time 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
we're going to make up for it, and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
concern ourselves with the real meat and potatoes of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
music -- the main course: melody. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Most people, when they think of music; think of melody right away,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to some people it's almost the same thing 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
-- melody; music. That's the whole meal. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And they're right, in a way, 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
SKIPPED
even though there are also such things in music as rhythm and harmony and counterpoint and orchestration; but melody is the main course, 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because what is music anyway but sounds that change and move along in time? 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And that's practically a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
definition of melody, too: different 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
notes that move along in time, 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
one after the other. Well, if that's true, 
(TO PIANO)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
then it's almost impossible to write music that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
doesn't have melody in it. I mean, if a 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
melody is simply one note coming after 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
another, 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
how can a composer avoid writing 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
melodies all the time? 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
He writes one note,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
then he writes another,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and he's already got a tiny two-note melody.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That's a melody -- sort of. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If he adds a third note 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
it begins to sound a little more melodic,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and if he then adds a few more

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:59.000
well, we've got Mendelssohn's Wedding March. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You see? Simple. Where there's 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
music, there has to be melody. You can't 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
have one without the other. Then why do

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
so many people complain about music that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
has no melody? Some people say they don't 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
like Bach fugues, because they don't find 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
melody in them. And others say the same 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
thing about Wagner operas, and others 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
about modern music, and others about jazz. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
What do you suppose they mean when they 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
say "no melody"? What are they 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
talking about? Isn't any string of notes 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a melody? Well, I think the answer is in 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the fact that melody can be a lot of 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
different things: it can be a tune, 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or a theme, or a motive, or a long melodic 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
line, or a bass line, or an inner voice

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 -- all those things: and the minute we 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
understand the differences among all 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
those kinds of melody, then I think we'll 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
be able to understand the whole problem.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You see, people usually think of a melody 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
as a tune, something you go out 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
whistling, that's easy to remember, that 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
"sticks in your mind."   Now a tune 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is usually complete in itself -- that is, it 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
seems to have a beginning, middle and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
end, 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and leaves you feeling satisfied -- in 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
other words, it's a song, like God Save the Queen, or Gershwin's 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Summertime, or Schubert's Serenade. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
But in 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
symphonic music, which is what we're 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
mostly concerned with here, tunes aren't 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
exactly in order, because 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
being complete in themselves, tunes don't cry 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
out for further development. And, as you'll 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
remember from our former programs, 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
development is the main thing in 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
symphonic music -- the growing and changing of a melodic 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
seed into a whole symphonic tree. So that 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
seed mustn't be a complete tune, but

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
rather a melody that leaves something

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
still to be said, to be developed 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
-- what is called a theme.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Well, that's already a disadvantage to those people who are always expecting 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
music to have full-blown tunes, 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and so they'll naturally find these incomplete

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
themes less melodic.  I suppose, 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000
then, that they should complain about the 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
famous opening 4-note theme of 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony: 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
which is hardly melodic at all.  Or about 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this theme from his 7th Symphony:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
which is all one note. 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But both of those themes are kinds of 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
melodies, you must remember, even though they're not tunes.  

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Of course, there are themes that 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.999
are much more tuneful than those. Only

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:02.000
think of Chaikovsky's Sixth Symphony 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Why that's practically a whole 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
tune in itself.  Now what is it about that big, 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
tuneful theme that makes it so

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
attractive and beloved -- 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
besides the fact that Chaikovsky 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was a melodic genius?  The answer is 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
repetition -- either exact repetition, or 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
slightly altered repetition, within the 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
theme itself. It's that repetition that 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
makes the melody stick in your mind; and 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's the melodies that stick in your 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
mind that are likely to please you the 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
most. 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
For instance, let's just 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
see how Chaikovsky went about building

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
up that lovely theme by 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
simply repeating his ideas in a certain 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
arranged order -- what I like to call the 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
1-2-3 method. The fascinating thing is that so many 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
famous themes are formed by exactly this

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
method; and so I think you ought to know 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
about it. Here's how it works: first,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:02.000
there is a short idea, or phrase;

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
2nd, the same phrase is repeated,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:17.000
but with some small variation;

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and 3rd, the tune 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
takes off in a flight  of inspiration. 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's like a 3-stage rocket, or 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
like the count-down in a race:  on your 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
mark,  get set, go! 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Or in target practices: ready, aim, fire! 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Or in a movie studio: lights, camera, 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
action! 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It's always the same, 1, 2, and 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
3! There are so many examples of this

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
melodic technique I almost don't know

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
where to begin,  But take, for 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
example, our good old stand-by, Beethovens

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Fifth, On your mark;  

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:28.000
get set; go! 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Or, do you know that 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
haunting tune in the Cesar Franck 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Symphony? Same thing. First, 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
a phrase; 

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
then repeat with a slight 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000
change, a rising intensity;  

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:01.000
then the take-off. 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Or Mozart's 

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Haffner Symphony: ready, (ORK) aim,  (ORK) fire!  (ORK)  

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
SKIPPED
The slow movement of Rimsky-Korsakoff's  Scheherazade,  (ORK) (V.O.)  A phrase:  same phrase, altered:  conclusion.  

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And so on. There are millions of them, 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
examples of this 1-2-3 design; 

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and don't forget that the heart of the 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
matter is repetition:  2 is always a 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
repeat of 1.  

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Now that we know a few of the 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
secrets that make music sound melodic, 

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
let's start looking for some of the 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
reasons why people find certain kinds of 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
music unmelodic.  We've already discovered 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that what appeals to people most as 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
melody is a fully spun-out tune, 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and that when they get instead an 

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
incomplete tune, or a theme, they begin to 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
have trouble.  So you can imagine that 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
when they hear music made out of 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
melodies that are even shorter than

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
themes, they have even more trouble. For 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
example, to return to that famous 4-note opening of 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Beethoven's Fifth:  

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That's so short it's not really even a theme, 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
but what is called a motive. Now a motive, 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
can be as little as 2 notes, or 3 

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
or 4, -- a bare melodic seed -- the raw 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
material out of which longer 

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
melodic lines are made. You remember 

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I said that certain people find Wagner's 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
operas unmelodic? This is why: because 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Wagner usually constructed his huge 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
operas out of tiny little 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
motives, instead of writing regular tunes 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
such as the Italian opera composers used. 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
But how wrong they are to say that Wagner 

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
doesn't write melody! 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
He writes nothing but melody, only it's 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
made out of motives. Let me 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
show you how.  You've all heard the prelude to his 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
great opera, Tristan &amp; Isolde, I'm sure. 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It begins with a 4-note motive.  

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Now immediately comes another

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
motive, also of 4 notes. Now the

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
exciting thing is the way Wagner puts 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
these two motives together:  he  makes the 

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
second motive begin smack on the end of 

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the first one, so that the last note of 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
one and the first note of the other are 

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
joined, locking the two 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:32.000
motives securely together. Like this: 

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Now he adds some marvelous harmony underneath, and 

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
this is what you get, as the beginning of 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Tristan:

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Now that's already much more than a 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
motive, or even of two motives -- it has 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
become what is called a phrase, just as a 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
series of words in a language is called a 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
phrase. And Wagner, by using this method 

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
of joining motives together and making 

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
phrases out of them, and then sentences 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
out of the phrases, and paragraphs 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
out of the sentences. Finally turns out a 

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
whole story, a prelude to Tristan that is 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
a miracle of continuous melody that seems to have no 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
end, even though there isn't a 

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
tune anywhere in it! Do you begin to see 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
what I mean by understanding melody in a 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
different way? If you think you don't 

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
just listen to a couple of minutes of 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
this famous prelude now, and I'm sure 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
you'll be surprised to find that you do 

00:13:28.000 --> 00:15:18.000
understand it very well.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Well, that's a, lot of 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
melody for a composer who is supposed to 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
be unmelodic. We have seen how his melody grows, 

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
starting with a motive, 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
then growing to a phrase, then to sentences. 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
SKIPPED
And it's not an unusual method of making melody, at all; I've even done it myself, in a more modest way. How many of you know the music of West Side Story? Well, what I like most about that music is how much of it grows out of a simple motive at the beginning of the score -- do you remember it?  
That's the gang call of The Jets --- you hear them whistling it all through the show to call each other. Well, all it is is 3 notes;   
but by juggling them around,  
and changing their order,  
all kinds of new melodies suddenly come to life.
For instance, in this order
the 3 notes give us:   
And the same three notes, put into a jumping jazz rhythm, turn out to be a song named "Cool" 
And there are many other ways in which this 3-note motive was used, but I don't want to take time to plug my own music.  I just want you to see how common it is for melody to grow out of motives; everybody does it, even me.  So you see, little motives are as much a part of melody as anything else. 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
But now comes an even more 

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
serious problem 

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
-- counterpoint. 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
That's what mostly gets in people's way when they are trying to hear a melody. 

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
They are always complaining about "those dry, difficult Bach Fugues! How can I hear the melody when there is so many things going on at once?""    

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SKIPPED
Well, your answer to that is:  "Just  open your ears and listen."   You see, people normally expect a melody to be on top of the music, with an accompaniment underneath, like a Chopin Nocturne. But why does it have to be on top? The melody can be on the bottom, or in the middle as well, as in any Bach fugue; but that doesn't make it any the less melodic. It may be a little harder, to have to look for the melody, instead of having it served to you on a silver platter, but think how much greater the satisfaction is when you find it! Now here's the start of a Bach fugue -- a very short theme, but perfectly melodic. Now it gets developed, as new voices join in the discussion, stating the same theme while other voices go on to other melodic statements at the same time.
You see how the main subject keeps turning up in different voices -- way down in the bass, or up on top, or in the middle? While the other voices go on singing other melodies. 

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
So it's certainly not an absence of melody, not by a long shot; in fact, 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
it's an overabundance of melody; 

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
SKIPPED
the whole fugue is one long outpouring of melody, just like the Tristan Prelude; only you have to know how to listen for the melody, and where to find it. So don't let anyone scare you with that terrible word counterpoint. 

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Counterpoint doesn't erase melody; on the contrary, it multiplies it.  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
SKIPPED
So it all adds up to what I said in the beginning; melody can be many kinds of things, and you mustn't expect it to be always the same thing -- namely, just a tune. It can be a short theme, or even a shorter motive; or it can appear in company with other themes, as in counterpoint, on top, or at the bottom, or in the middle.  But it's always melody, no matter how involved it gets in symphonic development.  

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Now that's a lot of hard stuff we've been 

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
discussing so far; and so to make it 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
clearer, we're going 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
to play you a whole movement from a 

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Mozart Symphony, the 1st movement of 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
his great G-Minor Symphony, which will 

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.999
illustrate everything we've been talking 

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.000
about. I'm sure you all know the 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
beautiful, famous theme that opens this movement 

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
-- a perfect example of the 

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
1-2-3 method we learned about 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000
before; first, a phrase;  

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
second, repeat the same phrase, 

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
slightly altered;  
and, third, the 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:33.000
take-off.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Now certainly nobody will quarrel with that 

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
as being unmelodic; it has such a 

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
beautiful shape, and arch. 

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
But in the course of 

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
the movement, as the theme is being 

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
developed, there are 

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
places that might be called unmelodic, 

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
or less melodic. But you're ready 

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
now to understand that even those places 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
are melodic, as much as the opening theme 

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
is -- if you just listen to them correctly. 

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
For instance, you'll notice that the very 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
first two notes of the main theme 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
form a little motive by 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
themselves, 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
a motive that is used all through the movement.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
SKIPPED
Do you remember how the theme ended just now?  
That's the same motive   
as the one at the beginning,  
only it's rising 
instead of descending. 

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Then later, while 

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
one part of the 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
orchestra is playing with that motive 

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
the strings are playing 

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
the same motive, 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000
only stretched out in long notes:  

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
So that together, it makes this 

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
wonderful sound.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And that's all made out of those first 

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
little 2 notes! 

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
So you see it's all pure melody, 

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
even the development parts. The same 

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
is true of this seemingly unmelodic section:  

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Some people would say that 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
passage lacks melody; but the theme is 

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
right there, only down in the bass 

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.000
instruments:
while on top 

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
there is exciting counterpoint going on, 

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
as in a Bach fugue.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
You just have to learn to listen for 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.999
melody in the depths of music, 

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:00.000
not only on top. 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And if you do, 

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
how different that same 

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
passage will sound to you!  

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:15.000
What's even 

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
harder is to hear melody that's neither 

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
on top nor at the bottom, but in the 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
middle, 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
sandwiched in. Here's one place 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000
you should be on the  lookout 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
for, where again the little 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
motive is being developed on top, over 

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:42.000
stationary notes on the bottom: 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
But in the middle, two 

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
clarinets are having their say about that 

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:54.000
motive: 

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And they're so sweet and tender that it 

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
would be a shame if you missed them. 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Listen 

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
to the whole sandwich now, top, bottom, 

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:17.000
and peanut butter:  

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Well, I think you're ready now to 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
hear this great movement by Mozart, and 

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
to listen to it as melody, all of it, from 

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000
start to finish, 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
not just the themes themselves, but the 

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
development of the themes and 

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
motives as well, in all their 

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
counterpoint. It's all melody -- every 

00:24:39.000 --> 00:25:10.000
moment.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Well, so far we've discussed 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
a few of the reasons why some people 

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
find certain music unmelodic -- 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
like melodies going against each other, as they do in 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
counterpoint, or a melody singing away 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
down in the bass, not easily recognized, 

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
or buried in the middle of a sandwich; or a melody 

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
constructed out of tiny motives.  

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
But the really 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
important reason -- and I guess this is 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
what I've been coming to all this 

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
time -- is the question of what our ears 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
expect -- in other words, taste. 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
And that, in turn, is based on what our 

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
ears are used to hearing.  

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
For instance, we've seen today how important 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
repetition is in making a melody easy to 

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
latch on to.  

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000
SKIPPED
We're used to that technique -- it's the technique used by popular songwriters: they drum their phrases into your head. 

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
OK -- so what happens when we hear melodies that don't repeat at 

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
all, that just weave on and on, always new?  

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Well, it's true that we usually like them 

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
less -- at first. But that doesn't mean 

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
they're any less melodic; in fact, the 

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
farther away you get from that kind of 

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
repetition, the 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
harder the melodies get to latch on 

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
to, but also the nobler and 

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
more beautiful they can become. Some of the 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
really greatest melodies ever written 

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
are of this kind, non-repeating long 

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
lines; but they're not necessarily the 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
ones people go around whistling in the 

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
streets.  

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
I remember so well the day my 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
piano teacher brought me a new piece to 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
study, 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Bach's Italian Concerto, when I was 14 years old; 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
and when I began to read the second movement, 

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
with its long, noble, ornamental melody line, 

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
I simply couldn't understand it.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
It just seemed to wander around, with no place to 

00:32:37.000 --> 00:33:09.000
go. Do you know it? 

00:32:37.000 --> 00:33:09.000
It goes like this:

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And so it goes weaving on, spinning out that 

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
long golden thread, never once repeating 

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
itself for almost five minutes. 

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
I find that melody one of the glories of all music,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
now today; but I sure didn't think so 

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
when I was 14.  

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
SKIPPED
Why did it seem to me so wandering and aimless? Because every phrase is new and different, instead of repeating previous phrases; and I was still young enough to think that every melody had to be a tune, 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
because that's what my 

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
brief musical experience had taught my 

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
ears to expect.  In exactly the same 

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
way that our tastes change with growing up, 

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
and hearing all kinds of music, 

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
so people's tastes change from one 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
period of history to another.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
The melodies people loved in Beethoven's 

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
time would have shocked and startled the 

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000
people of Bach's time, 100 years earlier, 

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
and I'm equally sure that some of 

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
today's modern music, which people 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
complain about as ugly and unmelodic, will

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
be perfectly lovely, charming every-day stuff to 

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000
the people of tomorrow. Let us 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
play you a perfect example -- another long, 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
non-repeating melodic line by the great 

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Modern German composer Paul Hindemith.  

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Hindemith wrote this melody over 30 

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
years ago, in a piece called Concert 

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Music for Strings and Brass; and I 

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
suppose there are still people who will call 

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
this unmelodic, even after 30 years. But I consider it one of the 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
most moving and beautifully shaped 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
melodies, not only of modern music, but of 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
all music; and I have a feeling that 

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
you'll agree with me, after all you've 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:36:55.000
learned about melody today

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Now that is a melodic line, four

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
minutes of beautiful curves, arches, peaks 

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
and valleys. 

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
And if there are any of you who did not 

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
like it, who found it unmelodic, awkward, or 

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
graceless, let me comfort you by saying 

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
that those were just the words 

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
used 80 years ago about another 

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
German composer named Brahms.  Now these 

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
days, when we think of melody, we almost 

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
immediately think of Brahms; but 

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
there was a time when people complained 

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
bitterly about his music as 

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
totally lacking in melody. And so, to wind 

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
up our program on melody, 

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
and to show you how careful you have to be in 

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000
judging melody, 

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
We are going to 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
play for you the last movement of Brahms 

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
4th Symphony -- an extraordinary 

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
movement for many reasons, but chiefly 

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.000
for the reason that its main theme isn't a melody at all.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
It's nothing but a scale of six notes 

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
plus two notes to finish it off; 

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
8 notes  in all, one to 

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
a bar,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
And out of those 8 bars comes a series of 

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
30 variations, each one exactly 8 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
bars long, and each one containing those 

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
same 8 simple notes, always in the 

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
same key. 

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
That's the whole movement. Now 

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
that doesn't sound very promising in 

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
terms of melody, does it? 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And yet, what Brahms gives us in 

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
this movement is a work of such glowing, 

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
fiery melodic invention as to leave us 

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
gasping. How does he do it? 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
By inventing new melodies in 

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
counterpoint to that main theme, by a brilliant use of motives -- 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
but I'm sure you'll hear all that without my telling you.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
You're ready now to listen to this 

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
so-called unmelodic work of Brahms, and hear it for the magnificent 

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
outpouring of melody that it really is. 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
And if you're still wondering what a 

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
melody is, just listen to this Brahms movement, and 

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
you'11 have the answer: melody is exactly 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:43:35.000
what a great composer wants it to be.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
