00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:28.000  
<v ANNOUNCER: (V.0)> (ON CUE) 
Carnegie Hall in New York City, the home of the world's greatest musical events.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:36.795  
Today's event is one in a series of New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts 

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.511
under the musical direction of Leonard Bernstein. 

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:48.498
(ON CUE . .) and here is Mr. Bernstein.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.090
<v BERNSTEIN> Gimme that spray.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.557
The kind that you spray.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.103
Oh, there's no time?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:55.087
No time?

00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:56.586
Alright then.

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:59.240
Okay

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.915
<v BERNSTEIN> O.K., now what do you think that music's all about? 

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:15.9140
Can you tell me?

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.605
That's just what I thought you'd say..... 

00:02:21.753 --> 00:02:26.351
cowboys, bandits, horses, the wild west

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:32.636
I know my little daughter Jamie who's five years old and who's sitting up there agrees with you.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:34.783
When she heard me play this piece, she said -

00:02:35.244 --> 00:02:38.015
"Ooo the Lone Ranger song, Hi-ho Silver!"

00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.529
Well, I hate to disappoint her,

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.576
and you too,

00:02:42.403 --> 00:02:44.565
but it really isn't about the Lone Ranger at all.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:46.962
It's about notes - 

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:50.210
E Flats and F sharps.

00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:56.229
You see, no matter how many times people tell you stories about what music means,

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:57.759
forget them.

00:02:58.626 --> 00:03:01.077
Stories are not what the music means ab-at all.

00:03:01.147 --> 00:03:03.825
Music is never about anything.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:05.426
Music just is.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:13.764
Music is notes; Beautiful notes and sounds put together in such a way that we get pleasure out of listening to them,

00:03:13.748 --> 00:03:14.841
that's all there is to it.

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:17.238
And when we ask "What does it mean - 

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.158
what does this piece of music mean?", 

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.828
then we're asking a very hard question. 

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.295
And that's the question we're going to try to answer today. 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:29.432
Now:

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.649
It's a funny thing about this meaning business -

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:33.984
in music, anyway.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:36.919
When you say "What does it mean?",

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.348
you're really saying is

00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:39.348
"What is it trying to tell me?",

00:03:39.995 --> 00:03:41.096
"What ideas

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:42.595
does it make me have?".

00:03:43.134 --> 00:03:44.133
Just like words;

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:46.421
when you hear words, you get ideas from them.

00:03:46.944 --> 00:03:47.966
If I say to you 

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:49.684
"Ow, I burned my finger!",

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:53.923
then immediately you get an idea from what I said or some ideas you get

00:03:54.524 --> 00:03:56.359
the idea that I burned my finger,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:57.507
that it hurts,

00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:00.504
that I might not be able to play the piano any more,

00:04:01.254 --> 00:04:04.158
or that I have a loud ugly voice when I scream - 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.219
lots of different ideas like that.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.296
That's words.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:10.490
But if I play you notes

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.175
just notes on the piano like that-

00:04:14.058 --> 00:04:15.814
those notes don't tell you any ideas;

00:04:16.564 --> 00:04:18.711
those notes aren't about burning your finger,

00:04:18.718 --> 00:04:21.740
or sputniks, or lampshades, 

00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:23.637
or rockets, or anything.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.034
Well what ARE they about?

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
They're about music.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:27.298
For instance, 

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:30.804
take this piece by Chopin. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.563
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:42.709
But what's it about? 

00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:43.888
Nothing.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.348
Or take this Beethoven Sonata-

00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:52.898
it's not about anything, either.

00:04:53.483 --> 00:04:55.818
Or take this piece of boogie-woogie. 

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.004
It's not about anything either.

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.612
They're NONE of them about anything!

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.993
But they're all fun to listen to.

00:05:13.586 --> 00:05:15.421
Why should they be fun to listen to?

00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:16.998
I don't know it's just,

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:20.222
part of human nature to like to listen to music. 

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:23.150
You see, notes aren't like words at all.

00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:27.639
Because if I say even one single word all by itself to you,

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.474
like "rocket", 

00:05:30.114 --> 00:05:32.956
immediately you have an idea you see a picture in your mind.

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:35.719
Rocket: Bang! Picture.

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.913
But if I play a note; one note all alone, 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.349
that means nothing. 

00:05:41.614 --> 00:05:45.057
It's just a plain old F sharp or a B flat.

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:47.727 
A sound, that's all, higher or lower,

00:05:48.617 --> 00:05:51.583 
louder or softer - a sound that can seem very different

00:05:52.044 --> 00:05:52.848 
if I play it,

00:05:53.808 --> 00:05:54.816 
or I sing it

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:57.751 
or if an oboe plays it

00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.975 
or if a xylophone plays it

00:06:04.004 --> 00:06:05.410 
or if a trombone plays it

00:06:08.431 --> 00:06:09.352
Very different. 

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:11.484 
It's all the same note -

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:13.545 
only with a different sound.
