00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)> (ON CUE)
From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
home of the world's greatest musical 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
events ------- the Bell Telephone System brings 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you another program in the award-winning 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
series. The New York Philharmonic Young 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
People's Concerts under the musical 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:05.000
direction of Leonard Bernstein.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And here is Mr. Bernstein

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000
<v Bernstein> You 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
probably all know what that exciting 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
little piece was - the Russian Sailors' Dance from the ballet "The Red Poppy" by Gliere. But even if you didn't 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
know it by name, I'11 bet you must have recognized 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
it as Russian music. And that's because 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
it is so full of Russian folk - flavor -- folk 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
melody, folk rhythm, folk spirit. In other words, it's 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
what is called nationalistic music - 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that is, music that reflects the nature or spirit of a 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
particular nation, whether that nation be 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Russia, or France, or Peru, or the Navajo 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Indian Tribe. For instance, if we play 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
this bit of music, you'11 immediately know it's - what?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
What is it? 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Or this one?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What is that? 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Well, anyway, that's the way music used to 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
be, neatly packaged with clear 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
nationalistic labels, and tied with 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
colorful native ribbons. But 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
these days it's a whole other

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
story. Especially since the last world 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
war. The most recent music has been

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
getting more and more international: in 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
other words, it's getting harder all the 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
time to spot what country a really 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
modern piece comes from. For instance, see 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
if you can tell the national origin of 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:54.000
this:

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Any suggestions:	

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
No one brave enough to try? 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
OK - It's 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
German; 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that was 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
a complete piece, amazingly enough, by the famous and very 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
influential composer Anton von 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Webern, written in the year 1923. 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Now, did you hear anything particularly

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
German about that music? Probably not.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now, here's another bit of music in 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
the same style. See if you have any 

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:52.000
better luck with it.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Does that begin to sound any more German 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.999
to you? 

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.000
Well, if it does, 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
there's something wrong, because what we 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
just played is not German at all, but a 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
piece by a modern Japanese composer 

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
named Mayazumi. Now how about that? If I 

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
hadn't told you that second piece of 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
music was by a Japanese, you'd never have 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
known it wasn't still the first German piece, would you have?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Or at least you wouldn't have known that we'd jumped 8,000 miles 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
from Germany to Japan, and the music hasn't 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
changed at all. So something 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
strange is going on these days, isn't it? 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Perhaps music is finally becoming what 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
so many people have liked to call 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it: a universal language. Now, just for fun,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
listen to this bit of music, written only

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
_________years ago, and see if you can tell what 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:04.000
country it's from:

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Same problem again. It could 

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
be by a German, or a Japanese, 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
but it happens to be by a gifted American 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
named Milton Babbitt. 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
*And here are a few bars by a young Italian 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
composer named Nono.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Again, that doesn't sound any more 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Italian than the Japanese piece did, does it?*

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Now, I don't want you to 

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
get the idea that all new music sounds 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
like this, or is all influenced by Webern. 

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's just that the general trend these 

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
days - the mainstream, you might say - is in this direction of an 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
international style. And I'm not saying that 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
this is either good or bad; it's just a 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
fact of history. With the world becoming 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
smaller all the time, with news and 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
fashions jumping over oceans in a matter 

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of minutes and seconds, with any spot 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
on the globe just a few hours away by 

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
air from any other spot - it's no wonder 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
that the world's music is becoming more 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and more alike. But there are lots of 

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
people who think that this is a pity; 

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and who long for the days 

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
when German music sounded German, 

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
when Japanese music sounded Japanese, 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and American music could always be spotted by its 

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
jazziness. Well, gone are the days. Now, I 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
don't want you to fall into the other 

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
trap of thinking that all old music was 

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
nationalistic, any more than I want you 

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to think all new music isn't. Up to

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
(CROSS TO PIANO) 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
the 19th century, most music was more or 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
less international in sound.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
For instance, this music is by 

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Bach

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And this is by Vivaldi 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Now even a musical expert 

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
would find it difficult to tell 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which was German and which Italian.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
But once we 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
come to the 19th century - ah, there's 

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
another story. There are two things that make the 19th century different:	one is that those hundred

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
years, from 1800 to 1900, were the time of 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the most tremendous nationalistic 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
spirit in Europe; and second, 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that most of the music we hear 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
in our concert halls today was written 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
somewhere in that period. So, 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
if you put those two facts together, you 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
get a third fact: that most of 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the music we still listen to today 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
is born of that fiery 

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
nationalistic feeling.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
SKIPPED
And that's why we still tend to lump music together according to nationality - French, German, Russian, American, and so on. 

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Just think of some of the 

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
best-known pieces of music: 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the prelude to Wagner's opera "Die 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Meistersinger."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000
(PLAY)

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Why that has 'Germany' written all over it: 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
ponderous, earnest, well-nourished. 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And the same thing is true of 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
almost all the countries of Europe 

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in the 19th century. This 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
nationalist fever caught on like wild-fire. 

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Out of Poland came Chopin, with 

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
his Polonaise and Mazurkas:

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
(Play)

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What else can that music be but Polish? And out of Itlay 

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
came a whole slew of marvelous operas, which are still today 

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
the mainstay of our opera houses. 

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Rigoletto - Tosca - Pagliacci - Traviata:

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(PlAY SEMPRE LIBERA)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:52.000
What can be more Italian than that?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And then, 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
of course, Russia, which was 

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
bursting with nationalistic composers 

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
all through the 19th century: Glinka, 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Borodin, Moussorgsky, Chaikovsky -

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(PLAY CHAIKOVSKY # 4)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
No two ways about that:	it's Russian music.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So, in the same 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
way, there were Albeniz and Granados from 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Spain, being very Spanish indeed; and 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
in Czechoslovakia (or Bohemia, as 

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
it was then known), there appeared Dvorak and 

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Smetana, both fierce nationalists; out 

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of Norway came Grieg, out of Finland, 

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Sibelius, out of Hungary, 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Liszt, and so on. Even our own 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
America, which was born late and took a 

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
long time to get going musically, had its 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
own 19th century nationalists:	

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
MacDowell with his Indian suites; 

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Henry Gilbert with his Negro and Creole 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.999
Dances. And let's not forget 

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:03.000
Ernest Schelling, the original founder 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
of these Young People's 


00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Concerts. He died twenty-five years ago this 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
month; and we honor him for the 

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
great work he did with his concerts for 

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
children, as well as for the proudly 

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
American nationalism of the music he 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
wrote. But the greatest American 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
nationalist of the time was certainly 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
that strange and salty New Englander, 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Charles Ives, whose 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
wildly original music has only recently 

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
begun to be known and appreciated. Ives 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
was a part-time composer; he 

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
sold insurance for a living, and composed 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
nights and on weekends; 

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
but somehow, in his half-amateur inspired 

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
way, he was able to produce music that 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
was not only full of nationalistic 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
American flavor, but that also 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
predicted many of the new, startling 

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
sounds that were later to become 

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
everyday stuff in what we now call 

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
'modern' music. Ives was a pioneer, a 

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
prophet, and a patriot - a real 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
old-fashioned American individualist, 

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
like Emerson and Thoreau. We are 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
going to play one of his 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
strangest compositions, a very 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
American piece called the "Fourth 

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
of July." In this amazing piece, we will be 

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
able to hear the whole story of Charles 

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Ives: his amazing invention 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
of new sounds, bold harmonies, and 

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
mad orchestration; and also his 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
great fascination with popular American 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
tunes. In this short 

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
piece we can hear snatches of more than 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
half-a-dozen such ditties, ranging from 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the bugle-call 'Reveille' to 'Yankee Doodle' - 

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and all mixed up together in sort of 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
dream-like far-out harmony. For it is a 

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
dream, this 'Fourth of July', as Ives tells us in his foreword to the score -- a boy's dream of 

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
that most exciting of all boys' holidays. 

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It is a dream in which sky-rockets are mixed up with 

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
marching bands, hymn-tunes, staying up 

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
late, and eating too much picnic food. And 

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
so all the familiar tunes come out 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
slightly twisted, a little bit wrong, as 

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
they might be in a dream of long ago.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
For instance, at one wild, climactic moment, 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000
the flutes are playing their 

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
version of 'Glory, Glory, Hallelujah'.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000
At the same time a cornet is blaring 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
the first part, 'Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory'

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:55.000
While the trumpets try to top the others with 'Columbia, 

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:12.000
the Gem of the Ocean'

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Now that's not just dream-like; it's 

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
probably the way the local band actually 

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
sounded when Ives 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
was a boy in the small town of 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Redding, Connecticut. 

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And that's also a part of his boyhood dream.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
But that's not all: at the same time, 

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
other people are trying to get 

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:57.000
through with 'Yankee Doodle'

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Now all those tunes go 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
together, somehow, tossed around in a feverish 

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
memory of drums, fireworks, and church-

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:21.000
bells:

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
What a dream! Almost a nightmare.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
SKIPPED
That's nationalistic music at its most original. It's hard to believe that this music was written way back in 1912!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And to make it all even more peculiar and dream-like, 

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Ives recalls for us the special 

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
sound of two bands playing at once. I'm 

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
sure you've all had that experience, 

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
during a parade, of hearing one band 

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
approach as another disappears, 

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
in two different rhythms.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Well, Ives actually makes this happen in 

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
the music, by splitting up the orchestra 

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
every once in a while into two 

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
orchestras; and for those moments we need 

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
two conductors to keep track 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
of what's going on. So don't be surprised 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
if now and again you find our assistant

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
conductor, ___________________________, suddenly 

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
standing up and conducting away in a 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000
whole other beat.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So here is the 'Fourth of July' by Charles Ives, - a piece that begins in

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
the wispy shadows of a dream, 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
gradually builds up by adding one tune on top of 

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
another, - marches, hymns, 

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
bells, fireworks - 

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
until the whole orchestra arrives 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
at one final dissonant shriek, 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and then suddenly peters out in a few wispy 

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000
dream-like notes, and it's all over, like waking up. 

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
You may not even realize this piece is 

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
over, it's so strange and sudden; 

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.999
so if you don't applaud, 

00:21:59.999 --> 00:27:58.000
we'll understand.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
That extraordinary piece by Charles 

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Ives was part of a 

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
tremendous movement in our country 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
to compose American sounding music. 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000
And this movement reached its peak in 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
our own century with Gershwin, who 

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
used jazz as the main nationalistic 

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
element, 

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
and with Aaron Copland, 

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
who used cowboy tunes and folk songs. 

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
But by 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
the 1940's, the movement was over, not only 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
in America, but all over the world.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
The last of the great nationalists in Germany 

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
was Hindemith; 

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
in Bohemia, 

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Mahler; in 

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Spain, de Falla; 

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
in Hungary, 

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Bartok - and they're all dead now. Even those 

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000
great nationalistic composers who are 

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
still living are not being very 

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
nationalistic anymore, like the Russian 

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Stravinsky, and the American Copland.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So, you see, times have changed; 

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
we're living in an international 

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
world. There are people who are 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
convinced that a new period of 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
nationalism is coming, especially in the 

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
music of the newer nations like Israel, 

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
and the newly-emerging 

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
countries of Africa and Asia. 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
It's possible, but at the moment we're still 

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
waiting. These days, audiences who 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
love music of a 

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
nationalistic kind have to cast a 

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
fond look backwards to the last century 

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
in order to satisfy their nostalgia. And so, 

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
for those people - and there are lots of them - we're going to spend the rest of 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
this hour playing two choice favorites 

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
from the good old days of nationalistic 

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
music. Our first stop on this sentimental

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.500
journey 

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.000
is Spain, and the music of Manuel de Falla.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
We're going to hear a suite from 

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
his famous ballet 'The 

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Three Cornered Hat'- a light delightful work 

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
full of Spanish fandangos and flamenco 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
spirit.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
The moment you hear a rhythm like this 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
(PLAY) 

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
you know you're in Spain. 

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Or a flamenco phrase like 

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:46.000
this 

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:46.000
(PLAY) 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:01.000
- or a dance tune like this 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:01.000
(PLAY)

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
These are the 

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Spanish materials out of which de Falla 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
weaves his colorful, nationalistic 

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
tapestry. Here are scenes and dances from 

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Part One of de Falla's ballet, 'The 

00:31:18.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Three Cornered Hat'.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:41:06.000
MATT:	DE FALLA TITLE CARD

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
We're going to end our program on 

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
nationalism by playing for you in its 

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
entirety perhaps the most famous of all 

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
nationalistic tone-poems, 'The Moldau,' by 

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
the Bohemian composer Smetana. 

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Into this endearing and enduring piece,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Smetana has poured all the tenderness 

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
and pride of his love of country, and has 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
produced this monument of patriotism 

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
which celebrates his native land by 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
describing an imaginary journey down its 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
most majestic river, the Moldau. You see, 

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
there are various ways in which a 

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
composer can pay homage to his country. 

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Ives did it by a musical celebration of 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
the Fourth of July, a great national holiday. 

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
De Falla did it by fashioning a 

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
large, beautiful ballet out of the folk-

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
songs and dances of his country.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
And now Smetana does it by celebrating 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
the natural beauties of his country.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
I'm sure you've heard enough about this 

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
piece to follow it 

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
without my giving you a road map:

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
the waves, the hunting

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
scene, the wedding scene, the moonlight 

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
scene, the stormy rapids, and so on. You'll 

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
recognize them all as you drift happily 

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
down Smetana's river; and as you drift,

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
you should feel a warm, romantic glow 

00:42:28.000 --> 00:53:15.000
from the nationalism that used to be.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
<v ANNOUNCER (V.O.)>From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center....
