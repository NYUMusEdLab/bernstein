The New York Philharmonic Young00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000People's Concerts under the musical00:00:40.000 --> 00:01:05.000direction of Leonard Bernstein.00:01:05.000 --> 00:05:00.000And here is Mr. Bernstein.00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000Hah Hahhh. A little out of breath from that one. You00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000probably all know what that exciting00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000little piece was. It's called the Russian00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000Sailors' Dance from the ballet "The Red00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000Poppy" by Gliere. But even if you didn't00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000know it by name, I'll bet you recognized00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000it as Russian music. And that's because00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000it's so full of Russian folk - spirit -- folk00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000melody, folk rhythm. In other words, it's00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000what is known as nationalistic music -00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000music that reflects the character of a00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000particular nation, whether that nation be00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000Russia, or France, or Peru, or the Navajo00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000Indian tribe. Now, for instance if we play00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000this bit of music, you'll immediately00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000know it's what? Try to guess. Twenty00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000guesses. Wrong. Right, right, right. Did I hear00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000Hungarian, correct. Liszt Second Hungarian00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000Rhapsody. Now try this one, maybe this00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:35.000will be easier for you.00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000What's that? Right! Well that's easy,00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000obviously everybody knew that one00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000Spanish. Right! That's from a ballet by De00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000Falla00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000Well, anyway that's the way music used to00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000be written, neatly packaged with clear00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000nationalistic labels, and tied with00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000colorful native ribbons. But I say used00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000to be, these days it's a whole other00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000story. Especially since the last world00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000war. The most recent music has been00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000getting more and more international: in00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000other words, it's becoming harder all the00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000time to spot what country a really00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000modern piece comes from. For instance, see00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000if you can tell the national origin of00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:54.000this:00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000Any suggestions:00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000No one brave enough to try? Somebody said00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000it over here, I think German. Alright it's00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000German; although I don't know how you00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000could tell. But amazingly enough that was00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000a complete piece, by the famous and very00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000influential Austrian composer Anton von00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000Webern, written in the year 1913.00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000Now, did you hear anything particularly00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000German about that music? No, Probably not.00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000All right, here's another bit of music in00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000the same style. And see if you have any00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:52.000better luck with it.00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000Does that begin to sound anymore German00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.999to you? No, doesn't sound any more German00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.000than the first one, I take it. If it does00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000there's something wrong, because what we00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000just played isn't German at all, but a00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000piece by a modern Japanese composer00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000named Mayazumi. Now how about that? If I00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000hadn't told you that the second piece of00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000music was by a Japanese, you'd never have00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000known, would you?00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000You see we've jumped six thousand miles00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000from Germany to Japan, and the music has00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000hardly changed at all. So something00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000strange is going on these days, isn't it?00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000Perhaps music is finally becoming what00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000so many people have always liked to call00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000it: a universal language. Now, just for fun,00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000listen to this bit of music, written in00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.0001948, and see if you can tell what00:09:40.000 --> 00:10:04.000country this is from:00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000How about that, same problem again. Could00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000be by a German, or by a Japanese, or I00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000heard somebody say Mars here before here.00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000But it happens not to be from00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000Mars it happens to be by an American00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000named Milton Babbitt, a very gifted00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.000composer.00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000Now here are a few bars by an Italian00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000composer this is just to complete our00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000little world trip, a young Italian00:10:33.000 --> 00:11:06.000composer named Nono.00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000Again, that doesn't sound any more00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000Italian than the Japanese piece did, do00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000you think so? No! Now I don't want you to00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000get the idea that all new music sounds00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000like this, or that it all sounds exactly00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000alike. It's just the general trend these00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000days is in the direction of an00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000international style. I'm not saying that00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000this is either good or bad; it's just a00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000fact of history. With the world becoming00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000smaller all the time, with news and00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000fashions jumping over oceans in a matter00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000of minutes or seconds even, with any spot00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000on the globe just a few hours away by00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000air from any other spot - it's no wonder00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000that the world's music is becoming more00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000and more alike. But there are lots of00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000people who think that this is a pity;00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000who long for the good old days00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000when German music sounded German, and00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000Japanese music sound Japanese, and you00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000could always spot American music by its00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000jazziness. Well, gone are the days. Now, I00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000don't want you to fall into the other00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000trap of thinking that all old music was00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000nationalistic, any more than I want you00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000to think that all new music isn't. Up to00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000the 19th century, most music was more or00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000less international in, in flavor, in sound.00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000For instance, this is a bit of music by00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000Bach, who as you know was a German.00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000Now here's a bit of music by Vivaldi, who00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:42.000as you know was an Italian. Practically00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000the same piece, even a musical expert00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000would find it difficult to tell which of00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000Those two was German and which Italian.00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000They sound so much alike. But once we00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000come to the 19th century - there we have00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000another story because those hundred00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000years, from 1800 to 1900, were the time of00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000the most tremendous nationalistic00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000politics and spirit in Europe; and also00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000most of the music that we still hear00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000today in our concert halls was written00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000somewhere in that hundred year period. So,00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000if you put those two facts together, you00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000get a third fact: which is that most of00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000the music we still hear today in our00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000concert halls comes out of one fiery00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000nationalistic feeling, or another from00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000the 19th century. Now just think of some of00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000the best-known 19th century pieces that00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000we still hear in our concert halls today:00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000like the prelude to Wagner's opera "Die00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:48.000Meistersinger."00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000That has Germany written all over it:00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000it's ponderous, earnest, well-nourished,00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000German. And now the same thing is true of00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000almost all the other countries of Europe00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000during that 19th century. This00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000nationalistic feeling was everywhere00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000For instance, out of Poland came Chopin, who00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000wrote Polonaises and Mazurkas by the00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:24.000Dozen like this: what else could that be00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000but Polish music? Then out of Italy there00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000came a whole slew of grand operas,00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000marvelous operas, which are still today00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000the mainstay of our opera houses. The00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000Rigoletto - Tosca - Pogliacci - Traviata and00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000all those famous tunes that you know. I'm00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:52.000sure, like this. That's Italian music. I mean, how00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000much more Italian can you get? And then,00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000of course, there was Russia, which was00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000bursting with nationalistic composers00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000all through the 19th century: Glinka,00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000Borodin, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, with00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:16.000pieces that went like this00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000Russian music, can't mistake it. It's00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000written all over it. And so in the same00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000way, there was Granados and Albeniz in00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000Spain, both being very Spanish indeed; and00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000in Czechoslovakia, or as it was known00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000then Bohemia, there appeared Dvorak and00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000Smetana, both fierce nationalists; and out00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000of Norway came Grieg, and out of Finland,00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000came Sibelius, and out of Hungary came00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000Liszt, and so on and on. Even in our own00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000America, which was born late and took a00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000long time to get going musically. We had00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000our own nineteenth-century nationalists00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000MacDowell with his Indian suites and00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000Henry Gilbert with his Negro and Creole00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.999Dances. And by the way, let's not forget00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:03.000Ernest Shelling, the original founder and00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000conductor of these Young People's00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000Concerts, who died 25 years ago this00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000month; and whom we are honoring for the00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000great work he did with his concerts for00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000young people, as well as for the proudly00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000American nationalism of the music he00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000wrote. But the greatest American00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000nationalist of the time was certainly00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000that strange and salty New Englander,00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000whose name was Charles Ives, and whose00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000wildly original music has only recently00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000begun to be known and appreciated. Ives00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000was a part-time composer; you know he00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000sold insurance for a living, and composed00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000on nights and weekends;00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000but somehow, in his half amateur inspired00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000way, he was able to produce music that00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000was not only full of nationalistic00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000American flavour, but music that also00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000predicted many of the new, startling00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000sounds that were later to become00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000everyday stuff in what we now call00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000'modern' music. Ives was a pioneer, and a00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000prophet, and a patriot - a real00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000old-fashioned American individualist,00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000like Emerson and Thoreau. Now we are00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000going to hear next one of his wildest00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000and most original compositions, a very00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000American piece indeed called the "Fourth00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000of July." In this amazing work, we'll be00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000able to get a full picture of Charles00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000Ives, including his fantastic invention00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000of new sounds, bold harmonies, and00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000and orchestrations; and also his00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000fascinating way with popular American00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000tunes. In the space of this one short00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000piece we can hear snatches of more than00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000half-a-dozen such ditties, ranging from00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000the bugle call 'Reveille' to 'Yankee Doodle' - 00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000and all mixed up together in a sort of00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000dreamlike, far out harmony. For it is a00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000dream, this 'Fourth of July', a boy's dream of00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000that most exciting of all boys holidays,00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000in which sky-rockets are mixed up with00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000marching bands, and hymn tunes, staying up00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000late, and eating too much picnic food. And00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000so all the familiar tunes come out00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000slightly twisted, a little bit wrong, as00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000they might be in a dream of long ago.00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000Especially with indigestion. For instance,00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000at at one wild, climactic moment, you00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000could hear the flutes playing their00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000version of 'Glory, Glory, Hallelujah'. Sounds00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000like this:00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.000And so on. At the same time the cornets are00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000at the same moment, mind you, are blaring00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000out the first part of the 'Mine Eyes00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000Have Seen the Glory' of that sounds like00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:55.000this: And at the same time the trumpets00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000and the trombones are trying to top the00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.999others with their version of 'Columbia,00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:12.000The Gem of the Ocean'. Like this. And now that's not00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000just dreamlike; you understand, that's00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000probably the way the local band actually00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000sounded when quite seriously when Ives00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000was a small boy in the small town of00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000Redding, Connecticut. He, they had a local00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000band which I'm sure sounded like that00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000then Ives was always trying to recall00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000his own childhood in his music in this00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000case he did it very graphically as you00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000hear, but it's part of that boyhood dream00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000and it's associated with the 4th of July.00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000But even that's not all: at the same time,00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000other instruments are trying to get00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:57.000through with the 'Yankee Doodle'.00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000Now somehow all those mad tunes go00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000together, tossed around in a feverish00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000memory of drums, fireworks, and church-00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:21.000bells. It sounds like this:00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000Some dream! Sounds more like a nightmare.00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000And to make it all even more peculiar,00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000Ives has recorded for us that special00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000sound of two bands playing at once. I'm00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000sure you've all had the experience,00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000during a parade, of hearing one band00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000approaching as another disappears, and00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000each one is in a different rhythm.00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000Well, Ives actually makes this happen in00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000the music, by splitting up the orchestra00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000every once in a while into two00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000orchestras; and for those moments we need00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000two conductors of course to keep track00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000of what's going on. So don't be surprised00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000if now and again you find our guest00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000conductor, Seymour Lipkin suddenly00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000standing up and conducting away and a00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000whole other beat. Mr. Lipkin. This00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000'Fourth of July' by Charles Ives, begins in00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000the spooky shadows of the night just00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000before dawn, you'll hear a little bird00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000calls piping in the night and even a00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000rooster crowing for day and then with00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000the coming of day the piece gradually00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000builds up by piling one sound on top of00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000another - or March, hymn,00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000church bells, fireworks, pipes, drums,00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000bugles - until the whole Orchestra arrives00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000at one final dissonant shriek, which is00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000supposed to be the sky rocket going off00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000above the town hall, looks as though the00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000town hall is is exploding, and then, it00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000all suddenly peters out in a few wispy00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000notes, like waking up from a dream. In00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000fact, you may not even realize the piece is00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000over, the ending is so strange and sudden;00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.999so if you hesitate about applauding, Mr.00:21:59.999 --> 00:27:58.000Lipkin and I will understand.00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000Now that extraordinary piece by Charles00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000Ives that we've just played was part of00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000a 19th century movement in our country00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000to compose American sounding music,00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000somehow or other make it sound American.00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000And this movement reached its peak in00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000our own century with Gershwin, who as you00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000know used jazz as the main nationalistic00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000element in his music, instead of00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000patriotic tunes. And with Aaron Copland,00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000who used cowboy tunes and folk songs as00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000his basic nationalistic element. But by00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000the 1940s, the movement was over, not only00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000in America, but all over the world. In00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000Germany, for example, the last of the00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000great nationalists was Hindemith, who you00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000may remember we talked about last season.00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000Apropos of his death, as you know he is00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000now dead as he, is Mahler who was the00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000last great nationalist in Bohemia; in00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000Spain the last great one was De Falla,00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000he's dead; and in Hungary it was00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000Bartok and he is dead. Now even those00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000great nationalistic composers who are00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000still living are not being very00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000nationalistic anymore, like the Russian00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000Stravinsky, or the American Copland, who00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000write in a rather international style00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000these days. So, you see, times have changed;00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000we're living now in an international00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000world. And there are people who are00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000convinced that a new period of00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000nationalism is coming, especially in the00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000music of the newer nations like Israel,00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000and possibly the newly-emerging00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000countries of Africa and Asia.00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000It's possible, but at the moment we're still00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000waiting. And these days audiences who00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000love to hear the music of a00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000nationalistic kind still have to cast a00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000fond look backwards to the last century00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000in order to satisfy their nostalgia. So,00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000we're dependent on a 19th century music00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000and so we're going to spend the rest of00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000this hour playing two choice favorites00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000from the good old days of nationalistic00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000music. Our first stop on this sentimental00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.000journey00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000is Spain and the music of Manuela de00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000Falla. We're going to hear a suite from00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000his very famous ballet 'The00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000Three-Cornered Hat'- a light humorous work00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000full of Spanish fandango's and flamenco00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000spirit.00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000This music is unmistakably Spanish. The00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000moment you hear a rhythm like this you00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000know you're in Spain.00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000That's absolutely Spanish, and could be00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000nothing else. Or of flamenco phrase like00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:46.000this which you'll hear in this music. Or00:30:46.000 --> 00:31:01.000a dance tune like this one.00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000There's no mistaking what that music is00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000I'm sure you'll agree. Now those are the00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000Spanish materials out of which de Falla00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000weaves his colorful, nationalistic00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000tapestry. Now here are the dances from00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000Part One of de Falla's great ballet, 'The00:31:18.000 --> 00:41:06.000Three-Cornered Hat'.00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000We're going to end our program on00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000nationalism by playing for you in its00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000entirety perhaps the most famous of all00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000nationalistic tone poems, 'The Moldau,' by00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000the famous Bohemian composer Smetana.00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000Into this endearing and enduring piece,00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000Smetana has poured all the tenderness00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000and pride of his love of country, and has00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.00produced this monument of patriotism00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000which celebrates his native land by00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000describing an imaginary journey down its00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000most majestic river, the Moldau. You see,00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000there are various ways in which a00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000composer can pay homage to his country.00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000Ives did it by a musical celebration of00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000the Fourth of July, a great national holiday.00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000And de Falla did it by fashioning a00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000large, beautiful ballet out of the folk-00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000songs and dances of his native country.00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000And now Smetana does it by celebrating00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000the natural beauties of his country.00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000You've probably heard enough about this00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000piece elsewhere to be able to follow it00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000without my giving you a road map: you've00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000heard about the lapping waves of the00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000Moldau, the stormy rapids, the hunting00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000scene, the wedding scene, the moonlight00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000scene, and so on. And I'm sure you'll00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000recognize them all as you drift happily00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000down Smetana's river; and as you drift,00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000you should feel a warm, romantic glow00:42:28.000 --> 00:53:15.000from the nationalism that used to be.00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000From Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center.....00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000the season's second New York00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000Philharmonic Young People's concert with00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000Leonard Bernstein has presented a00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000program titled "Farewell to Nationalism"...00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000featuring the Russian Sailors' Dance by00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000Gliere, the First Suite of Manuel00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000de Falla's "Three-Cornered Hat," "Fourth of00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000July," by Charles Ives and a performance00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000of "The Moldau" by Smetana. This program00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000was recorded in Philharmonic Hall and00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.000was produced and directed by Roger00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000Englander. The New York Philharmonic00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000Young People's concerts are presented by00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000The Bell Telephone System. The next00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000program in this series will be seen in00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000nine weeks, on Thursday January 28th, when00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000Mr. Bernstein will present "Young00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000Performers."
